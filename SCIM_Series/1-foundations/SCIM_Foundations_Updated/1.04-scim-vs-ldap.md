# 🏆 Section 1.04 | Foundations | **"SCIM vs LDAP vs Proprietary APIs"**

## 📌 At a glance  
SCIM is often compared to **LDAP** and to **proprietary user management APIs**.  
While they all deal with identity data, they serve **different purposes** and solve different problems.  

---

## 📖 What is the difference?  
- **SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)**  
  - A modern, open standard for **provisioning users and groups** across domains.  
  - Uses **REST + JSON** over HTTP.  
  - Defined by IETF in RFC 7643 (Schema) and RFC 7644 (Protocol).  

- **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**  
  - An older protocol used to **query and update directory services** (like Active Directory, OpenLDAP).  
  - Focused on **storing identity data** in hierarchical directories.  
  - Uses **binary + text encodings** over TCP, not REST.  

- **Proprietary APIs**  
  - Custom APIs provided by apps (e.g., Salesforce SOAP API, custom HR system API).  
  - Usually not standardized → each app requires its own connector.  
  - Often lack lifecycle focus or interoperability.  

**🔄 Mental map**
```text
SCIM → Standard protocol for provisioning between IdP and SaaS apps
LDAP → Directory query/update protocol (on-prem & some cloud directories)
Proprietary APIs → One-off, app-specific integration points
```

> **Note (worth keeping):** LDAP and SCIM are not competitors. LDAP is often used **within a directory**, while SCIM is used for **cross-domain provisioning**. Proprietary APIs are only used if SCIM is not available.  

---

## 🔑 Key characteristics  
- **SCIM** → Cloud-friendly, provisioning-focused, REST/JSON, standardized.  
- **LDAP** → Directory-first, complex schema, hierarchical queries, harder to extend.  
- **Proprietary APIs** → Vendor-specific, inconsistent, harder to maintain.  

---

## 🌍 Why it matters (and how it helps you later)  
- Clears up confusion → SCIM is not a “new LDAP.”  
- Helps you choose the right integration: use SCIM where possible, LDAP for directory lookups, and proprietary APIs as a fallback.  
- Prepares you to explain **why SCIM adoption is growing** in interviews and real-world projects.

## 🛠️ Where it’s used (flows + impact)
- **Joiner** → HR adds employee → IdP **POST /Users** → app account **created automatically**, no IT tickets required.
- **Mover** → Role/department change → IdP **PATCH /Users** or **PATCH /Groups** → roles, entitlements, and memberships **updated instantly**.
- **Leaver** → Exit event → IdP **DELETE /Users** or `active=false` → accounts **disabled across apps the same day**, no orphaned access.

👉 Without SCIM: weeks of manual tickets and scripts. With SCIM: minutes, fully auditable.

## 🔗 How this links to other concepts (learning bridges)
- **Core Objects (1.03)** → Lifecycle acts on Users & Groups. Without these, lifecycle has no targets.
- **CRUD Operations (3.04)** → JML maps directly to POST, PATCH/PUT, and DELETE or soft disable.
- **Failures (4.03)** → Shows what happens when lifecycle fails (e.g., orphaned accounts left active).

## ⚠️ Risks & issues
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Mis-mapped attributes | Inconsistent accounts | Validate schema mapping in pilots |
| Weak deprovisioning | Orphaned accounts remain active | Test disable/delete paths in each app |
| Partial vendor support | Missing PATCH or filters | Check `/ServiceProviderConfig`, plan workarounds |
| Protocol confusion | Wrong tool for the job | Train teams on SCIM vs SSO protocols |

Real-world: A company kept 200+ Slack users active months after exit because SCIM wasn’t connected. Audit flagged this as high-risk.
