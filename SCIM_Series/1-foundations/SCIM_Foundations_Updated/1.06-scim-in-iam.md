# 🏆 Section 1.06 | Foundations | **"Where SCIM fits in IAM (Provisioning vs Authentication Protocols)"**

## 📌 At a glance  
SCIM is a **provisioning protocol**, not an authentication protocol.  
It standardizes **how identities are created, updated, and removed** across systems, while protocols like **SAML, OIDC, and OAuth2** handle **login and access tokens**.  

---

## 📖 What is SCIM’s role in IAM?  
In IAM, multiple protocols serve different purposes:  

- **SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)**  
  - Handles **provisioning and deprovisioning**.  
  - Ensures accounts and groups exist in the right apps.  
  - Works asynchronously, triggered by HR or IAM events.  

- **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**  
  - Handles **authentication** (who you are) using XML assertions.  
  - Common for enterprise SSO into legacy web apps.  

- **OIDC (OpenID Connect)**  
  - Modern authentication protocol using **JWT tokens**.  
  - Built on top of OAuth2, widely used for web/mobile SSO.  

- **OAuth2**  
  - Handles **authorization**, issuing tokens for APIs/resources.  
  - Defines what you can do once authenticated.  

**🔄 Mental map**
```text
SCIM → Provisioning (accounts + attributes)
SAML/OIDC → Authentication (who you are, login sessions)
OAuth2 → Authorization (what you can access)
```

> **Note (worth keeping):** A user might be **provisioned by SCIM** into Slack days before they ever **authenticate with SAML or OIDC** to log in. SCIM prepares the account; SSO protocols control login.  

---

## 🔑 Key characteristics  
- **Provisioning vs Authentication** → SCIM = lifecycle, SAML/OIDC = login, OAuth2 = access tokens.  
- **Asynchronous vs Real-time** → SCIM acts when HR/IAM events occur, authentication happens instantly at login.  
- **Complementary, not competing** → SCIM ensures accounts exist, SAML/OIDC ensure secure login.  

---

## 🌍 Why it matters (and how it helps you later)  
- Clears up confusion between SCIM and SSO protocols.  
- Helps you explain SCIM’s **unique value** in interviews: it’s not about login, it’s about lifecycle.  
- Prevents wrong design decisions (e.g., trying to use SAML for provisioning).  
- Prepares you for vendor docs where SCIM and SSO protocols are configured side by side.

## 🛠️ Where it’s used (flows + impact)
- **Joiner** → HR adds employee → IdP **POST /Users** → app account **created automatically**, no IT tickets required.
- **Mover** → Role/department change → IdP **PATCH /Users** or **PATCH /Groups** → roles, entitlements, and memberships **updated instantly**.
- **Leaver** → Exit event → IdP **DELETE /Users** or `active=false` → accounts **disabled across apps the same day**, no orphaned access.

👉 Without SCIM: weeks of manual tickets and scripts. With SCIM: minutes, fully auditable.

## 🔗 How this links to other concepts (learning bridges)
- **Core Objects (1.03)** → Lifecycle acts on Users & Groups. Without these, lifecycle has no targets.
- **CRUD Operations (3.04)** → JML maps directly to POST, PATCH/PUT, and DELETE or soft disable.
- **Failures (4.03)** → Shows what happens when lifecycle fails (e.g., orphaned accounts left active).

## ⚠️ Risks & issues
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Mis-mapped attributes | Inconsistent accounts | Validate schema mapping in pilots |
| Weak deprovisioning | Orphaned accounts remain active | Test disable/delete paths in each app |
| Partial vendor support | Missing PATCH or filters | Check `/ServiceProviderConfig`, plan workarounds |
| Protocol confusion | Wrong tool for the job | Train teams on SCIM vs SSO protocols |

Real-world: A company kept 200+ Slack users active months after exit because SCIM wasn’t connected. Audit flagged this as high-risk.
