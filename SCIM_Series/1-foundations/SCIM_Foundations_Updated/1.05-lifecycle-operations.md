# 🏆 Section 1.05 | Foundations | **"Lifecycle Operations in SCIM"**

## 📌 At a glance  
SCIM is designed to automate **lifecycle events** — provisioning, updating, and deprovisioning users and groups.  
This aligns with the **joiner, mover, leaver (JML)** model used in Identity and Access Management (IAM).  

---

## 📖 What are SCIM lifecycle operations?  
Lifecycle operations describe the actions performed on identity objects (Users and Groups) throughout their existence.  
SCIM provides standardized ways to:  

- **Provision (Joiner)** → Create a new user or group.  
- **Update (Mover)** → Modify attributes (role, department, group membership).  
- **Deprovision (Leaver)** → Disable or delete accounts when no longer needed.  

**🔄 Flow overview**
```text
HR Event → IdP (SCIM client) → SCIM API → SP (SCIM server)
   Hire          POST /Users       →      new account created
   Transfer      PATCH /Users      →      attributes or groups updated
   Termination   DELETE /Users     →      account disabled or deleted
```

> **Note (worth keeping):** SCIM does not define *when* lifecycle operations should occur — that comes from HR or IAM policy. SCIM only standardizes *how* those changes are communicated to applications.  

---

## 🔑 Key characteristics  
- **Create (POST)** → Adds new Users or Groups.  
- **Update (PUT/PATCH)** → Modifies existing attributes or memberships.  
- **Delete (DELETE)** → Removes or disables the object.  
- **Search (GET)** → Retrieves objects for sync or validation.  
- **Stateless** → Each lifecycle call is independent and must include all required data.  

---

## 🌍 Why it matters (and how it helps you later)  
- Defines how joiner, mover, and leaver processes are automated in SCIM.  
- Prevents orphaned accounts by ensuring **timely deprovisioning**.  
- Helps you connect IAM policies to SCIM operations during implementation.  
- Prepares you for schema-level details (Section 2) and protocol-level CRUD (Section 3).

## 🛠️ Where it’s used (flows + impact)
- **Joiner** → HR adds employee → IdP **POST /Users** → app account **created automatically**, no IT tickets required.
- **Mover** → Role/department change → IdP **PATCH /Users** or **PATCH /Groups** → roles, entitlements, and memberships **updated instantly**.
- **Leaver** → Exit event → IdP **DELETE /Users** or `active=false` → accounts **disabled across apps the same day**, no orphaned access.

👉 Without SCIM: weeks of manual tickets and scripts. With SCIM: minutes, fully auditable.

## 🔗 How this links to other concepts (learning bridges)
- **Core Objects (1.03)** → Lifecycle acts on Users & Groups. Without these, lifecycle has no targets.
- **CRUD Operations (3.04)** → JML maps directly to POST, PATCH/PUT, and DELETE or soft disable.
- **Failures (4.03)** → Shows what happens when lifecycle fails (e.g., orphaned accounts left active).

## ⚠️ Risks & issues
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Mis-mapped attributes | Inconsistent accounts | Validate schema mapping in pilots |
| Weak deprovisioning | Orphaned accounts remain active | Test disable/delete paths in each app |
| Partial vendor support | Missing PATCH or filters | Check `/ServiceProviderConfig`, plan workarounds |
| Protocol confusion | Wrong tool for the job | Train teams on SCIM vs SSO protocols |

Real-world: A company kept 200+ Slack users active months after exit because SCIM wasn’t connected. Audit flagged this as high-risk.
