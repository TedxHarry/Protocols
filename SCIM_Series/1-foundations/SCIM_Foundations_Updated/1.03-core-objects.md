# 🏆 Section 1.03 | Foundations | **"Core Objects: Users & Groups"**

## 📌 At a glance  
SCIM is built around two core objects: **Users** and **Groups**.  
They are the foundation of identity management in SCIM and define how accounts and memberships are represented across systems.  

---

## 📖 What are SCIM core objects?  
SCIM defines standardized **resource types** that all implementations must support:  

- **User** → Represents an individual identity (employee, contractor, student).  
- **Group** → Represents a collection of users, usually tied to roles, teams, or permissions.  

Every SCIM integration revolves around these two objects because they cover the most common provisioning and deprovisioning scenarios.  

**🔄 Flow overview**
```text
IdP (client) ──> SCIM API ──> SP (server)
    POST /Users          →   new account created
    PATCH /Users         →   user updated
    POST /Groups         →   group created
    PATCH /Groups        →   membership updated
```

> **Note (worth keeping):** Users and Groups are **mandatory resources** in every SCIM implementation, even if the SP only partially supports them. Extensions and custom attributes build on top of these, not instead of them.  

---

## 🔑 Key characteristics  
- **Users and Groups are core resources** → everything else in SCIM depends on them.  
- **User object** includes identifiers, names, emails, phone numbers, and enterprise attributes.  
- **Group object** contains a `displayName` and a list of members (user references).  
- **Both are extensible** → enterprises can add attributes (e.g., costCenter, department).  
- **Always JSON-based** → portable across vendors.  

---

## 🌍 Why it matters (and how it helps you later)  
- Without understanding **Users and Groups**, SCIM payloads don’t make sense.  
- Helps you troubleshoot **account creation failures** (often missing required User attributes).  
- Helps you debug **group-based provisioning** in SaaS apps (Slack channels, Zoom licenses, ServiceNow roles).  
- Sets you up for the schema deep dive in Section 2, where each attribute is defined and extended.

## 🛠️ Where it’s used (flows + impact)
- **Joiner** → HR adds employee → IdP **POST /Users** → app account **created automatically**, no IT tickets required.
- **Mover** → Role/department change → IdP **PATCH /Users** or **PATCH /Groups** → roles, entitlements, and memberships **updated instantly**.
- **Leaver** → Exit event → IdP **DELETE /Users** or `active=false` → accounts **disabled across apps the same day**, no orphaned access.

👉 Without SCIM: weeks of manual tickets and scripts. With SCIM: minutes, fully auditable.

## 🔗 How this links to other concepts (learning bridges)
- **Core Objects (1.03)** → Lifecycle acts on Users & Groups. Without these, lifecycle has no targets.
- **CRUD Operations (3.04)** → JML maps directly to POST, PATCH/PUT, and DELETE or soft disable.
- **Failures (4.03)** → Shows what happens when lifecycle fails (e.g., orphaned accounts left active).

## ⚠️ Risks & issues
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Mis-mapped attributes | Inconsistent accounts | Validate schema mapping in pilots |
| Weak deprovisioning | Orphaned accounts remain active | Test disable/delete paths in each app |
| Partial vendor support | Missing PATCH or filters | Check `/ServiceProviderConfig`, plan workarounds |
| Protocol confusion | Wrong tool for the job | Train teams on SCIM vs SSO protocols |

Real-world: A company kept 200+ Slack users active months after exit because SCIM wasn’t connected. Audit flagged this as high-risk.
