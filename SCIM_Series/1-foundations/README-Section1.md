# 📚 Section 1 | Foundations

This section introduces the **foundations of SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)**.  
It explains what SCIM is, why it exists, its architecture, and how it compares to legacy systems like LDAP.  
You’ll also learn about SCIM core objects and lifecycle operations that power **Joiner, Mover, Leaver** flows.
