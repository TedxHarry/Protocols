# üèÜ Section 1.06 | Foundations | ‚ÄúSCIM in IAM‚Äù

---

## üìå At a glance
SCIM plays a central role in **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**, specifically in provisioning.  
It complements authentication (SAML/OIDC) and authorization (OAuth2/RBAC) by ensuring accounts exist in the right systems at the right time.  

---

## üìñ What is SCIM in IAM?
SCIM is the **provisioning pillar** of IAM. While authentication protocols verify identity and authorization frameworks enforce access, SCIM ensures the **identity records are created, updated, and removed** across all integrated applications.  

> **Notes**
- **SCIM = Provisioning** ‚Üí lifecycle automation.  
- **SAML/OIDC = Authentication** ‚Üí verifying who you are.  
- **OAuth2 = Authorization** ‚Üí granting tokens and scopes.  
- SCIM is the ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù that keeps accounts in sync across apps.  

---

## ‚ùó Problem before SCIM in IAM
- Authentication and authorization protocols solved **login** but not **account creation/deletion**.  
- IT teams manually created accounts before users could log in.  
- Offboarding delays created **compliance risks** ‚Üí users still had valid logins.  
- Organizations needed a **provisioning standard** to complete the IAM puzzle.  

---

## üîë Key characteristics
- **Completes IAM triangle** ‚Üí Provisioning (SCIM), Authentication (SAML/OIDC), Authorization (OAuth2/RBAC).  
- **Lifecycle automation** ‚Üí joiner, mover, leaver handled in real time.  
- **Cross-domain** ‚Üí works across SaaS, cloud, and enterprise apps.  
- **Audit-focused** ‚Üí creates evidence for provisioning and deprovisioning.  
- **Security impact** ‚Üí closes gaps that pure login protocols don‚Äôt cover.  
- **Standardized approach** ‚Üí reduces vendor lock-in compared to proprietary connectors.  

---

## üåç Why it matters (and how it helps you later)
- IAM professionals must know **how provisioning (SCIM) integrates with auth (SAML/OIDC) and access (OAuth2/RBAC)**.  
- Without SCIM, authentication is useless ‚Üí users may not even have accounts to log into apps.  
- Compliance teams rely on SCIM-driven provisioning for audit trails.  
- Career payoff: Knowing where SCIM fits into IAM makes you valuable for **IAM engineering, IGA projects, and CIAM solutions**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Where it‚Äôs used (flows + impact)

### IAM Triad
```
Provisioning ‚Üí SCIM
Authentication ‚Üí SAML / OIDC
Authorization ‚Üí OAuth2 / RBAC
```

### Example Flow
```
HR ‚Üí IdP ‚Üí SCIM ‚Üí App Account Created
‚Üì
User tries login ‚Üí SAML assertion / OIDC token validates identity
‚Üì
App enforces permissions ‚Üí OAuth2 / RBAC roles
```

Impact:  
- ‚ùå Without SCIM ‚Üí Accounts must be created manually before login can work.  
- ‚úÖ With SCIM ‚Üí Provisioning is automated; login + access control flows work seamlessly.

## üîó How this links to other concepts
- [1.05 Lifecycle Operations](1.05-lifecycle-operations.md) ‚Üí SCIM enables lifecycle automation inside IAM.  
- [6.02 Zero Trust](../6-advanced-future/6.02-zero-trust.md) ‚Üí SCIM helps enforce Zero Trust by ensuring only valid, current identities exist.  
- [6.03 CIAM vs IGA](../6-advanced-future/6.03-ciam-vs-iga.md) ‚Üí SCIM plays different roles in customer identity vs workforce governance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical deep dive

### Example: IAM with SCIM and OIDC
- **Step 1**: HR adds a user ‚Üí IdP triggers SCIM `POST /Users`.  
- **Step 2**: User attempts login ‚Üí OIDC issues an ID token.  
- **Step 3**: App checks if user exists (via SCIM-provisioned account).  
- **Step 4**: OAuth2 assigns scopes based on group memberships (provisioned via SCIM).  

**Key takeaway:** Authentication/Authorization fail if provisioning isn‚Äôt in place.  

---

## üè¢ Real-world scenario
A SaaS provider integrates SCIM for customer onboarding:  

- Before SCIM: Customers had to manually upload CSV files of users for provisioning. Authentication (SAML/OIDC) worked only if accounts already existed.  
- After SCIM: Accounts were auto-provisioned via IdP SCIM connector. Authentication and authorization became seamless.  

**Impact:** Reduced onboarding from 5 days ‚Üí under 1 hour, improved customer satisfaction, and eliminated missed offboarding.  

---

## ‚ùå Common pitfalls
- Treating SCIM as optional ‚Üí breaks IAM lifecycle automation.  
- Assuming authentication protocols handle provisioning.  
- Forgetting group provisioning ‚Üí impacts role-based access.  
- Not monitoring SCIM failures ‚Üí leads to ghost accounts.  
- Overlooking alignment of SCIM with RBAC/ABAC models.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & issues

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Provisioning gaps | Accounts missing ‚Üí login failures | Ensure SCIM in place before auth rollout |
| Orphaned accounts | Ex-employees keep access | Automate SCIM deprovisioning + monitoring |
| Schema mismatches | Incorrect group/role mapping | Validate schema across IdP and SP |
| Overlap confusion | Teams confuse provisioning with SSO | Document IAM architecture clearly |

**Real-world:** A company rolled out SSO (SAML) without SCIM. Hundreds of users couldn‚Äôt log in because accounts didn‚Äôt exist in SaaS apps.
