# 🏆 Section 1.02 | Foundations | **"SCIM Architecture"**

## 📌 At a glance  
SCIM follows a **client–server architecture** where an **Identity Provider (IdP)** acts as the client and a **Service Provider (SP)** exposes SCIM APIs as the server.  
This setup standardizes how identities are **provisioned, updated, and deprovisioned** across applications.  

---

## 📖 What is SCIM architecture?  
SCIM architecture describes the **roles and interactions** between systems that use SCIM to exchange identity data.  

- The **IdP (Identity Provider)** — such as Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, or SailPoint — **initiates** provisioning events.  
- The **SP (Service Provider)** — such as Slack, Zoom, or ServiceNow — exposes **SCIM endpoints** (`/Users`, `/Groups`) to receive and process these requests.  
- Communication happens over **REST APIs with JSON payloads**.  

**🔄 Flow overview**
```text
Identity Provider (IdP) ── SCIM API ──> Service Provider (SP)
    (create/update user)                 (account created/updated)
```

> **Note (worth keeping):** In SCIM, the IdP is always the **client** and the SP is always the **server**, even if both support APIs. Confusing this is a common mistake during troubleshooting.  

---

## 🔑 Key characteristics  
- **IdP as client** → always initiates provisioning requests.  
- **SP as server** → exposes SCIM API endpoints to process requests.  
- **Endpoints are predictable** → `/Users`, `/Groups`, `/Schemas`, `/ServiceProviderConfig`.  
- **RESTful interaction** → IdP sends POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, SP replies with JSON.  
- **Stateless operations** → each request is independent, following HTTP conventions.  

---

## 🌍 Why it matters (and how it helps you later)  
- Knowing the architecture helps you debug **who is responsible** when something fails (IdP or SP).  
- Explains why SCIM is so widely adopted — it keeps roles consistent across vendors.  
- Builds the mental model you’ll need before diving into **schemas** (Section 2) and **operations** (Section 3).  
- Prepares you to answer interview questions like *“Who initiates a SCIM request, IdP or SP?”*.  

---

## 🛠️ Where it’s used  
- **Okta → Slack**: Okta sends POST to Slack `/Users`.  
- **Entra ID → ServiceNow**: Entra ID calls ServiceNow SCIM endpoints to manage accounts.  
- **SailPoint → Workday**: SailPoint pushes joiner/mover/leaver events into Workday using SCIM.

**Key SCIM endpoints defined in RFC 7644:**  

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/Users` | Create, update, delete, and search for user resources |
| `/Groups` | Manage group objects and memberships |
| `/Schemas` | Retrieve schema definitions for objects |
| `/ServiceProviderConfig` | Returns SCIM features supported by the SP |

**Example: IdP creating a user in SP**  
```http
POST /scim/v2/Users
{
  "userName": "jdoe",
  "name": { "givenName": "John", "familyName": "Doe" },
  "emails": [{ "value": "jdoe@example.com", "primary": true }]
}
```

**SP Response:**  
```json
{
  "id": "a123",
  "userName": "jdoe",
  "active": true
}
```

<summary><strong>🏢 Real-world scenario</strong> (click to expand)</summary>
An enterprise uses Okta (IdP) to manage Slack (SP).  
- When HR adds a new employee, Okta **sends a POST** to Slack’s `/Users` endpoint.  
- Slack **creates the account** and returns the new user ID.  
- When the employee leaves, Okta **sends a DELETE**, and Slack **deprovisions** the account immediately.

<summary><strong>❌ Common pitfalls</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

- Misunderstanding roles (thinking SP initiates provisioning).  
- Assuming all endpoints are implemented (some SPs don’t support `/Groups`).  
- Forgetting to check `/ServiceProviderConfig` to see what the SP supports.  
- Confusing IdP SCIM client logs with SP SCIM server logs during troubleshooting.

<summary><strong>⚠️ Risks & issues</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| IdP/SP role confusion | Failed troubleshooting | Always confirm which side is client/server |
| Partial endpoint support | Missing features | Check `/ServiceProviderConfig` early |
| Network/API failures | Incomplete provisioning | Monitor retries and error logs |
