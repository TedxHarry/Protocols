# 🏆 Section 6.02 | Advanced & Future | “Zero Trust”

---

## 📌 At a glance
Zero Trust is a **security model** that assumes no user or system is inherently trusted.  
SCIM supports Zero Trust by ensuring **real-time provisioning and deprovisioning** of identities across applications.  

---

## 📖 What is Zero Trust in relation to SCIM?
Zero Trust means **“never trust, always verify”**.  
SCIM plays a supporting role by making sure **access reflects the latest identity state** in all connected apps.

> **Notes**
- Zero Trust requires **continuous authentication and authorization**.  
- SCIM ensures **least privilege and up-to-date account state**.  
- SCIM complements **SAML/OIDC (authn)** and **OAuth2 (authz)**.  

---

## ❗ Problems before Zero Trust + SCIM
- Legacy models assumed inside network = trusted.  
- Stale accounts remained active → insider risk.  
- Manual provisioning left **gaps between HR events and app access**.  

---

## 🔑 Key characteristics
- **Real-time deprovisioning** → Accounts disabled instantly.  
- **Joiner automation** → Immediate account creation with correct entitlements.  
- **Attribute accuracy** → SCIM ensures roles, departments, managers always current.  
- **Audit evidence** → Logs show consistent provisioning across SaaS.  
- **Complements MFA & adaptive access** → Enforced by IdPs but powered by accurate SCIM data.  

---

## 🌍 Why it matters (and how it helps you later)
- Zero Trust is the **dominant enterprise security model** today.  
- SCIM underpins Zero Trust by ensuring **no stale accounts exist**.  
- Makes you audit-ready by proving **identity lifecycle accuracy**.  
- Understanding SCIM + Zero Trust strengthens your IAM career.  

---

## 🛠️ Where it’s used (flows + impact)

### Example Flow (Leaver)
```
HR termination → IdP → SCIM PATCH active:false → SaaS App
```
- Account disabled instantly.  
- SaaS access blocked.  
- Zero Trust → No implicit trust for stale credentials.  

### Example Flow (Joiner + Zero Trust)
```
HR new hire → IdP → SCIM POST /Users → SaaS App
```
- Immediate creation with least privilege.  
- Zero Trust → No default access without role-based mapping.  

Impact: SCIM ensures Zero Trust rules are enforceable across apps.

- [6.01 SCIM 3.0](6.01-scim-3.0.md) → Future event-driven SCIM aligns directly with Zero Trust.  
- [6.03 CIAM vs IGA](6.03-ciam-vs-iga.md) → Zero Trust applies to both employee and customer identities.  
- [1.05 Lifecycle Operations](../1-foundations/1.05-lifecycle-operations.md) → Lifecycle automation is the core of Zero Trust provisioning.

## ⚙️ Technical deep dive

### SCIM + Zero Trust enforcement
- SCIM ensures **identity is correct in every SaaS app**.  
- IdP enforces **session-level Zero Trust** (MFA, device checks).  
- Combined: **Accurate identity + continuous verification**.  

### Example SCIM Disable Payload
```http
PATCH /Users/2819c223-7f76-453a-919d-413861904646
Content-Type: application/scim+json

{
  "schemas":["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
  "Operations":[{
    "op":"replace",
    "path":"active",
    "value":false
  }]
}
```
Impact: Ensures account is disabled across all connected systems.

## 🏢 Real-world scenario
A financial services firm adopted Zero Trust.  

- Before: Terminated employees retained SaaS access for days.  
- After SCIM: `PATCH active:false` executed within minutes.  
- **Impact:** Reduced insider threat risk and passed stringent audit.  

---

## ❌ Common pitfalls
- Thinking Zero Trust = just MFA.  
- Ignoring provisioning delays → stale accounts linger.  
- Relying only on network location for trust.  
- Not aligning SCIM with RBAC/ABAC policies.  
- Assuming Zero Trust eliminates the need for lifecycle management.  

---

## ⚠️ Risks & issues

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Slow deprovisioning | Access persists post-termination | Automate SCIM leaver flows |
| Attribute drift | Wrong entitlements | Sync attributes frequently |
| Partial vendor support | Inconsistent enforcement | Test vendor SCIM thoroughly |
| Misalignment with RBAC | Overprovisioned accounts | Align SCIM with policy models |

**Real-world:** A SaaS provider enabled MFA but left SCIM disabled. Stale accounts still accessed sensitive data. Only enabling SCIM-based lifecycle enforcement closed the gap.
