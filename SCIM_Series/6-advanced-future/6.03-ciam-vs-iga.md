# üèÜ Section 6.03 | Advanced & Future | ‚ÄúCIAM vs IGA‚Äù

---

## üìå At a glance
CIAM (Customer Identity and Access Management) and IGA (Identity Governance and Administration) are **two branches of identity management**.  
SCIM supports both, but their goals, flows, and scale differ significantly.  

---

## üìñ What is CIAM vs IGA?
- **CIAM** focuses on managing **external customers‚Äô identities** in apps and services.  
- **IGA** focuses on managing **internal workforce identities** with governance and compliance.  
SCIM can serve as the **provisioning layer** in both contexts, but usage patterns differ.

> **Notes**
- CIAM prioritizes **scalability, user experience, and self-service**.  
- IGA prioritizes **audit, compliance, and access governance**.  
- SCIM endpoints are common, but attribute mappings and flows diverge.  

---

## ‚ùó Problems before CIAM & IGA distinction
- Companies applied the same identity processes to both employees and customers.  
- Led to **poor UX for customers** or **weak compliance for workforce**.  
- No clarity on lifecycle models ‚Üí integration failures.  

---

## üîë Key characteristics

### CIAM
- Millions of external users.  
- Focus on registration, consent, privacy.  
- Lightweight SCIM attributes.  
- Self-service and delegated admin.  
- Scale and performance critical.  

### IGA
- Thousands of internal employees.  
- Strong compliance, SoD (Segregation of Duties).  
- Heavy use of roles, entitlements, groups.  
- Full Joiner/Mover/Leaver lifecycle.  
- Audit-ready provisioning.  

---

## üåç Why it matters (and how it helps you later)
- Distinguishing CIAM vs IGA helps design **fit-for-purpose SCIM integrations**.  
- IAM engineers must tailor provisioning flows to **either compliance-heavy (IGA)** or **scale-heavy (CIAM)**.  
- Strengthens your ability to explain trade-offs in audits and architecture reviews.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Where it‚Äôs used (flows + impact)

### CIAM Example Flow
```
Customer signup ‚Üí App ‚Üí SCIM ‚Üí CRM / SaaS services
```
- Provision account instantly.  
- Lightweight attributes (email, phone, consent).  

Impact: Smooth UX, customer retention.

### IGA Example Flow
```
HR hire ‚Üí IdP ‚Üí SCIM ‚Üí SaaS App
```
- Provision account with entitlements.  
- Governance rules enforced.  

Impact: Compliance, risk reduction.

## üîó How this links to other concepts
- [6.02 Zero Trust](6.02-zero-trust.md) ‚Üí Zero Trust applies to both CIAM and IGA differently.  
- [1.05 Lifecycle Operations](../1-foundations/1.05-lifecycle-operations.md) ‚Üí Lifecycle differs between workforce and customer identities.  
- [6.04 Future Trends](6.04-future-trends.md) ‚Üí CIAM and IGA convergence is a major trend.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical deep dive

### Example: CIAM SCIM payload
```http
POST /Users
{
  "userName": "customer123",
  "emails": [{ "value": "customer123@example.com" }],
  "phoneNumbers": [{ "value": "+1555000111" }],
  "consent": true
}
```

### Example: IGA SCIM payload
```http
POST /Users
{
  "userName": "employee01",
  "externalId": "E12345",
  "name": { "givenName": "John", "familyName": "Doe" },
  "entitlements": [
    { "value": "FinanceApp-Role" },
    { "value": "AD-Group-123" }
  ]
}
```

## üè¢ Real-world scenario
A retail company used one SCIM design for both employees and customers.  

- CIAM users were forced into workforce schema ‚Üí poor UX.  
- Workforce lacked full entitlements mapping ‚Üí compliance issues.  
- Split design into **CIAM (light attributes)** and **IGA (full governance)**.  

**Impact:** Customers enjoyed smoother signups, auditors gained full compliance visibility.  

---

## ‚ùå Common pitfalls
- Assuming CIAM = IGA.  
- Overloading customer schema with compliance attributes.  
- Underestimating scale challenges in CIAM.  
- Ignoring governance in IGA.  
- Forgetting that SCIM alone doesn‚Äôt enforce consent or SoD.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & issues

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Schema overload | Poor UX for CIAM | Keep CIAM schema lightweight |
| Weak governance | Audit findings in IGA | Apply SoD and role modeling |
| Scale issues | CIAM outages | Test SCIM server for millions of users |
| Attribute misalignment | Failed integrations | Separate mappings for CIAM vs IGA |

**Real-world:** A SaaS vendor reused workforce SCIM schema for CIAM. Customer signups failed because required HR attributes (employeeId) were missing. Splitting schemas fixed the issue.
