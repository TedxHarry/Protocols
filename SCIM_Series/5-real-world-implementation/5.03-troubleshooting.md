# 🏆 Section 5.03 | Real-world Implementation | “Troubleshooting”

---

## 📌 At a glance
Troubleshooting SCIM integrations means systematically analyzing **requests, responses, and logs**.  
Most issues fall into common categories: **auth failures, schema mismatches, vendor limits, or network problems**.  

---

## 📖 What is Troubleshooting in SCIM?
It’s the process of identifying and resolving SCIM provisioning issues by following structured steps.  
It combines **client-side inspection, server logs, and RFC knowledge** to pinpoint root cause.

> **Notes**
- RFC 7644 Section 3.12 defines error formats.  
- `/ServiceProviderConfig` and `/Schemas` help reveal vendor quirks.  
- Always capture **HTTP request + response payloads** for debugging.  

---

## ❗ Problem before structured troubleshooting
- Teams wasted hours chasing random failures.  
- No standard playbook meant repeated mistakes.  
- Errors ignored in logs → orphaned accounts or failed syncs.  

---

## 🔑 Key characteristics
- **Pattern-based** → Most issues map to known categories.  
- **Evidence-driven** → Always inspect request/response pairs.  
- **End-to-end visibility** → Requires logs from IdP + SCIM server.  
- **Iterative** → Fix, retest, validate against RFC.  
- **Teachable** → Playbooks improve team speed.  

---

## 🌍 Why it matters (and how it helps you later)
- Speeds up **root cause analysis** (RCA).  
- Builds confidence with vendors and auditors.  
- Reduces downtime for Joiner/Mover/Leaver flows.  
- Makes you a stronger IAM engineer by recognizing patterns instantly.  

---

## 🛠️ Where it’s used (flows + impact)

### Example Joiner Failure Flow
```
IdP → SCIM POST /Users → Error Response → Logs
```
- Missing `userName` → 400 invalidValue.  
- Fix mapping → Re-run, user created.  

### Example Leaver Failure Flow
```
IdP → SCIM PATCH active:false → 401 Unauthorized → Logs
```
- Token expired.  
- Refresh token → Retry successful.  

Impact: Structured troubleshooting cuts downtime and ensures compliance.

## ⚙️ Technical deep dive

### Step 1: Reproduce with Postman
- Copy failing request into Postman.  
- Send again with clean payload.  
- Compare to successful requests.  

### Step 2: Inspect request/response pair
```http
POST /Users
Content-Type: application/scim+json

{
  "userName": "jsmith",
  "emails": [{ "value": "jsmith@example.com" }]
}
```
**Error Response**
```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
{
  "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:Error"],
  "scimType": "invalidValue",
  "detail": "Missing required attribute externalId",
  "status": "400"
}
```

**Fix**: Add `externalId` mapping.

### Step 3: Check `/ServiceProviderConfig`
- Is PATCH supported?  
- Is Bulk supported?  
- Adjust client logic.  

### Step 4: Inspect Logs
- Look at IdP logs (Okta, Azure AD).  
- Look at SCIM server logs.  
- Compare timestamps, IDs, and request bodies.  

### Step 5: Retry with Fix
- Apply mapping fix.  
- Retest Joiner/Mover/Leaver flows.  
- Confirm compliance logging.

## 🏢 Real-world scenario
A university’s HR-driven deprovision flow failed silently.  

- Logs showed `PATCH active:false` requests returned 401.  
- Postman confirmed expired tokens.  
- Engineers implemented token refresh.  

**Impact:** Hundreds of orphaned accounts cleaned up, audit risk removed.  

---

## ❌ Common pitfalls
- Blaming vendor before checking your payload.  
- Ignoring error `scimType` details.  
- Forgetting to URL-encode filters.  
- Not testing with `/Schemas` to confirm attributes.  
- Skipping token refresh testing.  

---

## ⚠️ Risks & issues

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Payload errors | Failed provisioning | Validate against `/Schemas` before send |
| Vendor quirks | Misdiagnosis | Always check `/ServiceProviderConfig` |
| Expired tokens | Orphaned accounts | Implement token refresh logic |
| Missing logs | Hard to debug | Collect request+response pairs |

**Real-world:** A team spent weeks chasing 409 conflicts. Root cause was duplicate `externalId`. Correct correlation logic fixed the sync instantly.

## 📝 Mini quiz
1. You see 400 invalidValue on `POST /Users`. What should you check first?  
   a) Logs only  
   b) Payload mapping against required schema fields  
   c) Server version  
   d) Retry job blindly  

2. Which tool is best to reproduce and isolate SCIM issues?  
   a) Browser  
   b) Postman  
   c) Text editor  
   d) Wireshark  

3. Scenario: Your deprovision calls fail with 401 Unauthorized. What’s the most likely fix?  
   a) Add missing externalId  
   b) Refresh expired tokens  
   c) Switch to Bulk calls  
   d) Use Basic Auth instead of OAuth2
