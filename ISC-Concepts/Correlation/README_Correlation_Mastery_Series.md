# SailPoint Identity Security Cloud – Correlation Mastery Series

> **Purpose of this repository**  
This series provides a **complete, end-to-end mastery of Correlation in SailPoint Identity Security Cloud (ISC)**.  
It is designed to move you from mental models → configuration → runtime behavior → troubleshooting → advanced enterprise scenarios.

This is **not** a UI walkthrough.
It teaches *how ISC actually thinks and behaves* so correlation becomes predictable, defensible, and auditable.

---

## Who this series is for

This series is valuable if you are:
- An IAM engineer designing or operating SailPoint ISC
- Troubleshooting correlation issues that feel “random”
- Preparing for audits, migrations, or large app onboarding
- Working with complex identity lifecycles (rehire, contractors, M&A)
- Tired of trial-and-error correlation fixes

---

## How to use this series

Read the parts **in order** the first time.

Each part builds on the previous one:
- early parts build intuition
- middle parts explain execution and risk
- later parts handle real-world complexity and governance

You can later jump directly to a part when troubleshooting.

## Series Structure (Mental Flow)

**Think → Design → Execute → Interpret → Fix → Defend**

That is the journey this series follows.

## What makes this series different

- Explains **why** correlation behaves the way it does
- Separates **inference vs overrides vs persistence**
- Focuses on **defensible ownership**, not just automation
- Teaches **operator-level troubleshooting**, not guessing
- Designed for **real enterprises**, not lab tenants

---

## Final Note

If correlation feels unpredictable, it usually means:
- identity readiness was incomplete
- sequencing was wrong
- or an old decision is being preserved

This series gives you the tools to **prove which one**.
