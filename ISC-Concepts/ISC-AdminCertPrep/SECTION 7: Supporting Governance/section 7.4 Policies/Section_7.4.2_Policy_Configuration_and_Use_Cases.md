# Section 7.4.2: Policy Configuration and Use Cases

**SailPoint Identity Security Cloud (ISC) Administrator Certification**
*Section 7: Supporting Governance | Module 7.4: Policies*

---

## Overview

This section covers the end-to-end workflow for creating, configuring, testing, and managing policies within SailPoint Identity Security Cloud. Building on the policy types introduced in Section 7.4.1, we now move into the practical mechanics of policy implementation — how to translate compliance requirements into enforceable rules within ISC.

**Key learning objectives:** Understand the step-by-step policy creation workflow, configure each policy type with appropriate rules and conditions, apply testing strategies before production deployment, manage policy exceptions through mitigation workflows, and map real-world compliance requirements to ISC policy configurations.

---

## Policy Creation Workflow

Creating a policy in ISC follows a structured process. The workflow is the same regardless of whether you are creating a Separation of Duties (SoD) policy, an access policy, or an account policy — the differences lie in the rule configuration details.

### General Policy Creation Steps

1. Navigate to **Admin > Governance > Policies** in the ISC admin console.
2. Click **Create Policy** and select the policy type (SoD, Access, or Account).
3. Define the policy name, description, and owner (the identity responsible for managing violations).
4. Configure the policy rules (this is where the specifics diverge by type).
5. Set the violation action (e.g., allow and flag, prevent, require approval).
6. Configure notification settings for violations.
7. Save the policy in a **Draft** or **Active** state.
8. Run a **policy simulation** to evaluate impact before enforcement.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Policy Owner vs. Policy Administrator**
>
> The **policy owner** is the identity assigned responsibility for reviewing and managing violations generated by the policy. This is typically a compliance officer or business owner. The **policy administrator** is the ISC admin who has the governance permissions to create and configure policies. These are different roles — the exam may test your understanding of who is responsible for what.

### Policy States

Policies in ISC exist in one of two states, and understanding the distinction is critical for deployment strategy.

| State | Behavior | When to Use |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Policy is saved but NOT enforced. It will not generate violations, trigger alerts, or block access. You can run simulations against a draft policy. | During initial creation and testing. Use this state while you validate the policy rules against your identity population before going live. |
| **Active** | Policy is fully enforced. Depending on configuration, it will detect violations, send alerts, and can prevent or flag conflicting access. | After testing confirms the policy generates expected results with acceptable false positive rates. Move to Active when stakeholders have approved enforcement. |

> 📘 **EXAM TIP: Policy State Behavior**
>
> A Draft policy will NOT generate violations even if identities in the environment match the policy rules. Only Active policies produce violations. If an exam scenario describes a newly created policy that is not generating expected violations, the **first thing to check** is whether the policy state is Active.

---

## Configuring Separation of Duties (SoD) Policies

SoD policies are the most commonly tested policy type on the certification exam. They enforce the principle that certain combinations of access should not be held by the same identity because they create a conflict of interest or a fraud risk.

### SoD Policy Architecture: Left and Right Sets

Every SoD policy rule is built on the concept of two entitlement sets — referred to as the **Left Set** and the **Right Set**. A violation occurs when a single identity holds at least one entitlement from the Left Set AND at least one entitlement from the Right Set simultaneously.

**How it works:** ISC evaluates each identity against the SoD rule by checking whether the identity's current entitlements intersect with both sets. If the identity holds Entitlement A from the Left Set and Entitlement X from the Right Set, a violation is triggered.

| Component | Left Set | Right Set |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Defines the first group of conflicting entitlements. Represents one side of the duty separation. | Defines the second group of conflicting entitlements. Represents the other side of the duty separation. |
| **Example** | "Create Purchase Orders" entitlement from SAP | "Approve Purchase Orders" entitlement from SAP |
| **Selection Scope** | Can include entitlements from one or multiple sources. Can include access profiles or roles. | Can include entitlements from one or multiple sources. Can include access profiles or roles. |
| **Violation Trigger** | Violation = Identity has **at least one** from Left AND **at least one** from Right | The sets are evaluated with a logical AND between them. Within each set, entitlements are evaluated with OR logic. |

> 🔴 **CRITICAL CONCEPT: AND Between Sets, OR Within Sets**
>
> This is one of the most tested concepts for SoD policies. Within the Left Set, if you list 5 entitlements, an identity only needs **ONE** of them. Within the Right Set, same thing — only **ONE** is needed. But to trigger a violation, the identity must have at least one from **EACH** set. Think of it as: **(Any from Left) AND (Any from Right) = Violation**.

### Step-by-Step: Creating an SoD Policy Rule

1. In the policy configuration, click **Add Rule** under the SoD policy.
2. Name the rule descriptively (e.g., "PO Creation vs. PO Approval Conflict").
3. **Build the Left Set:** Search for and select the entitlements, access profiles, or roles that represent one side of the conflict. You can search across all connected sources or filter by specific source.
4. **Build the Right Set:** Repeat the process to select the entitlements representing the conflicting side.
5. Review the rule summary. ISC will show you the number of identities currently matching the rule.
6. Save the rule. You can add multiple rules to a single SoD policy.

### SoD Policy Configuration Example: Financial Controls

**Scenario:** Your organization's compliance team requires that no single person can both create vendor records and approve payments to those vendors in your ERP system.

- **Policy Name:** Vendor Management – Payment Fraud Prevention
- **Policy Owner:** Chief Compliance Officer
- **Rule Name:** Vendor Creation vs. Payment Approval

| Left Set (Vendor Management) | Right Set (Payment Processing) |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| SAP: `Create_Vendor_Master` | SAP: `Approve_Payment_Run` |
| SAP: `Modify_Vendor_Master` | SAP: `Release_Payment_Batch` |
| Oracle EBS: `AP_VENDOR_CREATE` | Oracle EBS: `AP_PAYMENT_APPROVE` |

**Analysis:** Notice that this SoD rule spans multiple source systems (SAP and Oracle EBS). ISC evaluates the identity's aggregated entitlements across all connected sources. A user who has `Create_Vendor_Master` in SAP and `AP_PAYMENT_APPROVE` in Oracle EBS would trigger a violation, even though the entitlements are in different systems. This cross-application SoD enforcement is a key differentiator of ISC.

### Multiple Rules Within a Single SoD Policy

A single SoD policy can contain multiple rules. Each rule is evaluated independently. This allows you to group related separation requirements under one policy umbrella.

**Example:** A "Financial Controls SoD Policy" might contain three rules:
- Rule 1: Vendor Creation vs. Payment Approval
- Rule 2: Journal Entry Creation vs. Journal Entry Posting
- Rule 3: Budget Modification vs. Expense Approval

**Each rule generates its own violations independently.** An identity could violate Rule 1 without violating Rule 2 or Rule 3. Violations are tracked per-rule, not per-policy. This is important for remediation because each violation identifies the specific conflict.

> ✅ **BEST PRACTICE: Rule Granularity**
>
> Create rules at the most specific level of the business conflict. Don't create one massive rule with 50 entitlements in each set — this makes violations vague and hard to remediate. Instead, create targeted rules that map to specific compliance requirements. The policy owner should be able to look at a violation and immediately understand what conflict exists.

---

## Configuring Access Policies

Access policies detect when identities have specific combinations of access that violate organizational rules — but unlike SoD policies, access policies are not limited to two conflicting sets. They use a more flexible condition-based approach.

### Access Policy Rule Structure

Access policy rules use conditional logic to define what constitutes a violation. The conditions can reference identity attributes, entitlements, roles, and access profiles.

**Key difference from SoD:** Access policies evaluate whether an identity's access matches a defined condition set. They are useful for enforcing rules like "no contractor should have admin-level access" or "identities in the Finance department should not have IT infrastructure entitlements unless explicitly approved."

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Identity Criteria** | Filters which identities the policy applies to based on identity attributes (department, type, lifecycle state, etc.). | Department = "Human Resources" AND Identity Type = "Contractor" |
| **Access Criteria** | Defines the specific access (entitlements, roles, or access profiles) that triggers a violation when the identity criteria is also met. | Has entitlement: `AD_Domain_Admin` OR Has role: `IT_Infrastructure_Admin` |
| **Violation Logic** | A violation occurs when an identity matches BOTH the identity criteria AND the access criteria simultaneously. | Contractor in HR who has Domain Admin rights = Violation |

### Access Policy Configuration Example: Contractor Restrictions

**Scenario:** Your security team mandates that no contractor should hold any entitlement classified as "privileged" across any connected system.

- **Policy Name:** Contractor Privileged Access Restriction
- **Policy Owner:** CISO

**Identity Criteria:**
- Identity Attribute: `employeeType` = "Contractor"

**Access Criteria:**
- Entitlement Classification = "Privileged" (any source)
- OR: Role contains "Admin" in name

**How ISC evaluates this:** During each policy check (either scheduled or triggered by access changes), ISC filters identities where `employeeType` = Contractor, then checks if any of those identities hold entitlements tagged as Privileged or roles containing "Admin." If both conditions are true for an identity, a violation is generated.

> 📘 **EXAM TIP: Access Policy vs. SoD Policy Selection**
>
> If the exam describes a scenario where the conflict is between **TWO types of access** (e.g., "can't have both X and Y"), the answer is an **SoD policy**. If the scenario describes a restriction based on **WHO the identity is** combined with **WHAT access they hold** (e.g., "contractors cannot have admin access"), the answer is an **access policy**. The distinguishing factor is whether the rule involves identity attributes in the condition.

---

## Configuring Account Policies

Account policies focus on the identity-to-account relationship rather than specific entitlements. They enforce rules about how many accounts an identity should have on a given source, or whether certain account attributes are configured correctly.

### Account Policy Rule Types

| Rule Type | What It Detects | Real-World Use Case |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Multiple Account Detection** | Identifies identities that own more than the expected number of accounts on a specific source system. | Detect when a user has 3 Active Directory accounts (likely indicating orphaned or shared accounts that should be cleaned up). |
| **Account Attribute Validation** | Validates that account-level attributes meet expected standards or match identity attributes. | Ensure that the "manager" field on every AD account matches the identity's current manager from HR. Flag mismatches. |
| **Orphan Account Detection** | Finds accounts on a source that are not correlated to any identity in ISC. | Identify service accounts or legacy accounts on a database server that have no owner, creating security risk. |

### Account Policy Configuration Example: Multiple Account Detection

**Scenario:** Your organization's policy states that each employee should have exactly one Active Directory account. Multiple accounts may indicate shared accounts, leftover test accounts, or re-hire scenarios that were not properly handled.

- **Policy Name:** AD Account Proliferation Control
- **Source:** Active Directory (Production)
- **Threshold:** Maximum 1 account per identity
- **Action on Violation:** Generate alert to IT Operations team and flag for review in next certification campaign

**What happens when triggered:** After an aggregation from Active Directory, ISC evaluates the correlation results. If identity "John Smith" is correlated to accounts `jsmith`, `john.smith`, and `jsmith-test` on the same AD source, ISC generates a policy violation indicating John Smith has 3 accounts when the maximum allowed is 1.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Account Policies and Aggregation Timing**
>
> Account policy evaluations are typically triggered after source aggregation completes. This means a violation may not appear immediately when an account is created — it will be detected on the next aggregation cycle. This is different from SoD policies, which can also be evaluated during access request processing (preventive mode).

---

## Testing Policies Before Deployment

One of the most critical steps in policy management — and one that is frequently tested on the exam — is the ability to simulate and validate a policy before activating it. ISC provides built-in simulation capabilities to help administrators understand the impact of a policy on their identity population.

### Policy Simulation

Policy simulation (also called policy preview or impact analysis) runs the policy rules against the current identity data without generating actual violations or sending notifications.

**What simulation shows you:**
- The total number of identities that would be in violation
- Which specific identities match the policy rules
- Which specific entitlements, roles, or accounts trigger the violation for each identity
- An exportable report for stakeholder review

### Pre-Deployment Testing Workflow

1. Create the policy in **Draft** state.
2. Configure all rules with the intended entitlement sets, conditions, and criteria.
3. Run simulation and export results.
4. Review results with the policy owner and compliance team.
5. Identify expected violations (true positives) vs. unexpected results (false positives or misconfigurations).
6. Adjust rule configuration if necessary (narrow or broaden entitlement sets).
7. Re-run simulation to verify adjustments.
8. Once validated, transition the policy to **Active** state.

> 🔴 **CRITICAL: Never Skip Simulation**
>
> Activating an untested policy in a production environment can generate hundreds or thousands of violations overnight, overwhelming policy owners with alerts and potentially blocking legitimate access requests if the policy is configured in preventive mode. Always simulate first. The exam will present scenarios where simulation is the correct answer to questions about "what should you do before activating a policy?"

### Interpreting Simulation Results

| Simulation Outcome | Likely Cause | Action | Risk if Ignored |
|-------------------|--------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Very high violation count (e.g., 500+ identities)** | Entitlement sets are too broad, or the business process inherently requires this access combination. | Review rule scope with business. Consider narrowing entitlement sets or creating exceptions for legitimate roles. | Alert fatigue, compliance team overwhelmed, policy becomes meaningless. |
| **Zero violations** | Policy is correctly configured and no conflicts exist, OR the entitlement names/IDs are incorrect and the rule is not matching. | Verify entitlement values in the rule match actual aggregated entitlement values. Check for typos or stale entitlement references. | False sense of compliance if the policy is misconfigured. |
| **Expected violation count matches known exceptions** | Policy is correctly configured. Known exceptions are business-justified. | Document exceptions, configure mitigating controls, activate the policy. | Minimal — this is the ideal outcome. |
| **Unexpected identities in violation** | Identities have access you didn't know about, or the entitlement set captures unintended entitlements. | Investigate whether the access is legitimate. Adjust the rule or initiate access cleanup. | If legitimate access, users may be blocked. If illegitimate, a real security gap exists. |

---

## Policy Exceptions and Mitigation Workflows

In the real world, not every policy violation can or should be immediately remediated. Sometimes a legitimate business need requires an identity to hold conflicting access temporarily or permanently. ISC handles this through policy exceptions and mitigating controls.

### Understanding Policy Exceptions

A policy exception is a documented acknowledgment that a specific identity is allowed to remain in violation of a policy for a defined period, with compensating controls in place.

| Exception Component | Description | Example |
|--------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Exception Justification** | Business reason why the identity must retain the conflicting access. | "Small team requires one person to perform both functions during Q4 close. Additional manual review is in place." |
| **Mitigating Control** | The compensating control that reduces the risk of the violation. This is the key to making an exception defensible in an audit. | "Manager reviews all payment batches weekly." OR "Dual-approval required for transactions over $10,000." |
| **Expiration Date** | When the exception expires and the violation must be re-evaluated. Exceptions should not be permanent without strong justification. | "Exception expires March 31, 2026. Must be renewed with fresh justification or access must be remediated." |
| **Approver** | The identity who approved the exception. This creates an audit trail. | CFO or Chief Compliance Officer. |

### Mitigation Workflow in ISC

1. A policy violation is detected for an identity.
2. The policy owner or violation reviewer determines that the access is business-justified and cannot be removed.
3. The reviewer initiates a mitigation by documenting the justification and specifying the mitigating control.
4. An approver (typically a senior stakeholder) reviews and approves the exception.
5. ISC records the exception with the mitigation details, approver, and expiration date.
6. The violation remains on record but is marked as **"Mitigated"** rather than **"Open."**
7. When the exception expires, the violation returns to **"Open"** status for re-evaluation.

> ✅ **BEST PRACTICE: Mitigating Controls Must Be Real**
>
> Auditors will challenge exceptions where the mitigating control is vague or unverifiable. "Manager is aware" is NOT a sufficient mitigating control. A proper mitigating control is specific, measurable, and documented: "Manager runs a weekly report of all payments processed by this user and signs off on each batch, with reports archived in SharePoint."

> 📘 **EXAM TIP: Mitigated vs. Resolved**
>
> Know the difference: A **MITIGATED** violation means the access conflict still exists, but a compensating control is in place and the exception is approved. A **RESOLVED** violation means the conflicting access has been removed — one or both of the conflicting entitlements have been revoked. The exam may ask what happens when an exception expires: the answer is that the violation status changes from Mitigated back to Open.

## Real-World Policy Use Cases and Decision Matrix

This section maps common compliance and security scenarios to the appropriate ISC policy type and configuration approach. Use this as a reference for both exam preparation and production implementation.

### Policy Selection Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Policy Type | Rule Configuration | Key Consideration |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Person who creates purchase orders cannot also approve them. | **SoD** | Left: PO_Create entitlements. Right: PO_Approve entitlements. | Cross-source if PO creation and approval are in different systems. |
| No contractor should have access to production database admin roles. | **Access** | Identity: Type=Contractor. Access: Role=DB_Admin or DB_Prod_Write. | Update rule if new privileged roles are added to the environment. |
| Each user should have only one account per source system. | **Account** | Source: Active Directory. Max accounts: 1. | Exclude service account sources from this rule. |
| No one in Finance should also have access to modify HR compensation data. | **SoD** | Left: Finance entitlements (GL, AP, AR). Right: HR Compensation entitlements. | May need broad entitlement sets; simulate carefully for false positives. |
| Terminated employees must not have any active accounts. | **Account** | Identity Lifecycle State = Terminated. Account Status = Active. | Pair with lifecycle automation to auto-disable accounts on termination. |
| Interns should not hold any role classified as management-level. | **Access** | Identity: Job Code starts with "INT". Access: Role classification = Management. | Depends on accurate role classification metadata in ISC. |
| System admin who can create user accounts cannot also assign security clearances. | **SoD** | Left: Account provisioning entitlements. Right: Security clearance entitlements. | Common in government and defense contractors. High regulatory scrutiny. |

---

## Preventive vs. Detective Policy Enforcement

Policies in ISC can operate in two enforcement modes. Understanding the difference is essential for the exam and for real-world implementation.

| Mode | Preventive | Detective |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **When Evaluated** | At the time of access request, before the access is provisioned. | After access has been granted, typically during scheduled policy scans or after aggregation. |
| **Effect on Access** | Can BLOCK the access request from being fulfilled. The requester and approvers are notified of the conflict before provisioning. | Does NOT block access. Access is already provisioned. The violation is flagged for review and remediation. |
| **User Experience** | Requester may see a warning or be prevented from submitting the request. Approver sees the conflict during approval. | No impact on the user at the time of access grant. They may later be contacted about the violation. |
| **Best For** | High-risk SoD violations where the conflicting access should never be granted together (e.g., financial fraud risks). | Lower-risk violations, policy rollout phases, or environments where blocking would disrupt operations. |
| **Limitation** | Only works for access granted through ISC access requests. Does NOT catch access granted directly on target systems (out-of-band). | Violation is detected after the fact. There is a window of risk between when access is granted and when the violation is detected. |

> 🔴 **CRITICAL EXAM CONCEPT: Preventive Enforcement Limitations**
>
> Preventive mode ONLY catches violations for access granted through the ISC access request process. If an administrator grants entitlements directly on a target system (bypassing ISC), the preventive policy will NOT catch it. The violation will only be detected in detective mode during the next policy scan or aggregation. This is why most organizations use BOTH modes: preventive to block what they can, and detective to catch what slips through.

### Combining Preventive and Detective Enforcement

The recommended approach for high-risk policies is to enable both preventive and detective enforcement. Here is how this works in practice:

1. A financial SoD policy is configured with preventive enforcement enabled.
2. When a user requests "Approve Payments" access through ISC, the system checks whether the user already holds "Create Payments" access.
3. If a conflict is detected, the request is flagged (or blocked, depending on configuration). The approver sees the SoD conflict.
4. Separately, a scheduled policy scan runs nightly in detective mode, checking all identities against the same policy.
5. The detective scan catches any conflicts that were introduced outside of ISC (direct grants, bulk imports, role changes in the source system).
6. Both types of violations appear in the policy violation dashboard for the policy owner to review.

---

## Policy Scheduling and Automation

Detective policies need to run on a schedule to detect violations. ISC provides scheduling options that determine how frequently policies are evaluated.

### Scheduling Options

- **After aggregation:** The policy is evaluated automatically after a source aggregation completes. This ensures violations are detected as soon as new data is imported.
- **Scheduled frequency:** The policy runs on a defined schedule (daily, weekly, monthly). The schedule should align with the risk level of the policy — higher risk policies should run more frequently.
- **On-demand:** An administrator can manually trigger a policy evaluation at any time. Useful for ad-hoc compliance checks or after making configuration changes.

> ✅ **BEST PRACTICE: Policy Scheduling**
>
> For high-risk SoD policies (financial controls, regulatory requirements), run policy evaluations daily or after every aggregation. For informational policies (like account proliferation monitoring), weekly or monthly scans are usually sufficient. Balance detection speed against system performance impact.

## Section Summary and Key Exam Concepts

### Quick Reference: Policy Configuration Checklist

- **Policy type selection:** SoD for conflicting access, Access for identity-attribute-based restrictions, Account for account-level rules.
- **SoD architecture:** Left Set AND Right Set. OR within each set. Cross-source evaluation.
- **Policy states:** Draft (no enforcement) vs. Active (full enforcement). Always start in Draft.
- **Simulation:** Always run before activating. Review results with policy owner.
- **Exceptions:** Require justification, mitigating control, expiration date, and approver.
- **Enforcement modes:** Preventive (blocks at request time, ISC channel only) and Detective (detects after the fact, catches all channels).
- **Scheduling:** High-risk = daily/after aggregation. Lower-risk = weekly/monthly.

### Concepts Most Likely to Appear on the Exam

| Concept | What to Know |
|---------|-------------|
| **SoD Left/Right Set Logic** | AND between sets, OR within sets. Identity needs at least one from each set to violate. |
| **Draft vs. Active Policy State** | Draft policies do NOT generate violations. First troubleshooting step for missing violations. |
| **When to Use SoD vs. Access vs. Account** | SoD = conflicting duties. Access = identity attribute + access restriction. Account = account-level hygiene. |
| **Preventive Enforcement Limitation** | Only catches access granted through ISC request process. Out-of-band grants are not blocked. |
| **Policy Simulation Purpose** | Run before activation to assess impact. Prevents alert fatigue and accidental access blocking. |
| **Mitigated vs. Resolved Violations** | Mitigated = access conflict still exists with compensating control. Resolved = conflicting access removed. |
| **Exception Expiration** | Expired exception returns violation to Open status. Must be re-evaluated. |
| **Policy Owner vs. Administrator** | Owner = business stakeholder who reviews violations. Admin = IT person who configures the policy. |

> 📘 **FINAL EXAM TIP: Policy Troubleshooting Pattern**
>
> If the exam presents a scenario where a policy is not working as expected, use this checklist:
> 1. Is the policy **Active**, not Draft?
> 2. Are the entitlement values in the rule matching the **actual aggregated values**?
> 3. Has **aggregation run** since the policy was activated?
> 4. For preventive mode, is the access being requested **through ISC** or granted directly?
> 5. Is the identity **in scope** for the policy (correct identity profile, lifecycle state, etc.)?
