### 7.2.3: Work Reassignment Functionality

### Overview
Work reassignment capabilities allow approvers to transfer approval responsibilities to others when appropriate. Understanding the differences between reassignment types, when to use each, and how to manage reassignment workflows is essential for efficient approval processing and the certification exam.

**What you'll learn:**
- Forward vs. Reassign vs. Delegate differences
- Manual reassignment procedures
- Bulk reassignment operations
- Delegation workflows
- Reassignment permissions and controls
- Audit trail and tracking
- Reassignment best practices

### Reassignment Types

#### Understanding the Three Methods

**The three reassignment methods have distinct purposes and behaviors:**

| Method | Original Approver | New Approver | Reversible | Use Case |
|--------|------------------|--------------|------------|----------|
| Forward | Removed | Takes full ownership | No | Permanent transfer |
| Reassign | Retains visibility | Takes ownership | Yes (recall) | Temporary transfer with oversight |
| Delegate | Retains authority | Advisory/helper role | Yes (revoke) | Seek input, retain control |

---

#### Method 1: Forward

**Definition:** Permanently transfer work item to another approver, removing original approver's responsibility.

**How it works:**
```
Before Forward:
Work item assigned to: manager.smith
Status: Pending
Manager.smith has: Full decision authority

After Forward:
Work item assigned to: manager.jones
Status: Pending (with new approver)
Manager.smith: Removed from work item
Manager.jones: Full decision authority

Result:
- Manager.smith no longer sees work item
- Manager.smith cannot make decisions
- Manager.jones owns the approval completely
- Not reversible by manager.smith
```

**Example scenario:**
```
Situation:
Manager Smith receives approval request for specialized access
Manager Smith lacks technical knowledge to evaluate

Action:
Manager Smith forwards to Technical Lead
Reason: "Technical expertise required - forwarding to subject matter expert"

Outcome:
Technical Lead: Sees work item in "My Work"
Technical Lead: Makes approval decision
Manager Smith: No longer involved
Request: Proceeds based on Technical Lead's decision
```

**When to use FORWARD:**
```
✓ Wrong approver assigned (routing error)
✓ Approver lacks expertise/authority
✓ Permanent transfer needed
✓ Original approver should not be involved
✓ Organizational change (role transfer)

Example triggers:
- "This should be approved by application owner, not me"
- "I don't manage this person anymore"
- "This is outside my area of responsibility"
- "Forward to security team for risk assessment"
```

---

#### Method 2: Reassign

**Definition:** Transfer work item to another approver while retaining ability to recall/monitor.

**How it works:**
```
Before Reassign:
Work item assigned to: manager.smith
Status: Pending
Manager.smith has: Full control

After Reassign:
Work item assigned to: manager.jones (new owner)
Status: Pending with reassignment
Manager.smith: Can recall if needed
Manager.jones: Current decision authority

Reassignment properties:
- Manager.smith can recall reassignment
- Manager.smith can see reassignment status
- Manager.jones makes actual decision
- Manager.smith notified of final decision
```

**Example scenario:**
```
Situation:
Manager Smith going on vacation for 2 weeks
Has 15 pending approval requests
Needs coverage during absence

Action:
Manager Smith reassigns all 15 items to Manager Jones (backup)
Reason: "Vacation coverage - please review these items"
Return date: 2 weeks

Outcome:
Manager Jones: Reviews and decides on all 15 items
Manager Smith: Receives summary upon return
Manager Smith: Could recall if returns early
Audit trail: Shows reassignment chain
```

**When to use REASSIGN:**
```
✓ Temporary coverage needed (vacation, sick leave)
✓ Workload distribution
✓ Want visibility into decisions made
✓ May need to recall items
✓ Bulk transfer of multiple items

Example triggers:
- "I'm on vacation next week, need coverage"
- "Too many items to review, split with peer"
- "Get second opinion but retain oversight"
- "Temporarily overwhelmed, need help"
```

---

#### Method 3: Delegate

**Definition:** Request another person's input while retaining final decision authority.

**How it works:**
```
Before Delegate:
Work item assigned to: manager.smith
Status: Pending
Manager.smith has: Full decision authority

After Delegate:
Work item still assigned to: manager.smith (primary)
Delegated to: technical.lead (advisor)
Status: Pending delegation review

Delegation properties:
- Manager.smith retains ownership
- Technical.lead provides recommendation
- Manager.smith makes final decision
- Manager.smith can accept/reject recommendation
```

**Example scenario:**
```
Situation:
Manager Smith receives request for database admin access
Manager Smith understands business need
Unsure about technical prerequisites

Action:
Manager Smith delegates to Database Team Lead
Question: "Does this person meet technical requirements?"
Delegation type: Advisory (recommendation only)

Flow:
1. DB Team Lead receives delegation request
2. DB Team Lead reviews technical qualifications
3. DB Team Lead recommends: "Approve - prerequisites met"
4. Recommendation returns to Manager Smith
5. Manager Smith reviews recommendation
6. Manager Smith makes final decision (can approve or deny)

Outcome:
Manager Smith: Makes final decision with expert input
DB Team Lead: Advisory role only
Audit trail: Shows both manager's and delegate's inputs
```

**When to use DELEGATE:**
```
✓ Need expert opinion/advice
✓ Want to retain final authority
✓ Collaborative decision-making
✓ Training/mentoring scenario
✓ Quality assurance check

Example triggers:
- "Need technical validation before deciding"
- "Want security team's opinion on risk"
- "Let junior manager practice, I'll review"
- "Compliance check needed before approval"
```

### Reassignment Best Practices

#### When to Use Each Method

**Decision matrix:**

| Situation | Use | Reason |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Wrong approver assigned | Forward | Permanent routing fix |
| Going on vacation | Reassign | Temporary with recall |
| Need expert opinion | Delegate | Retain authority, get advice |
| Approver terminated | Admin reassign | Administrative cleanup |
| Workload too high | Reassign (bulk) | Distribute burden |
| Training new approver | Delegate | Oversight + learning |
| Organizational change | Forward | New ownership |
| Second opinion needed | Delegate | Advisory input |

---

#### Efficient Reassignment Workflows

**Best practice 1: Proactive delegation setup**
```
Before vacation:
1. Set up delegation rule in advance
2. Configure delegation period
3. Specify delegate
4. Test with one item
5. Activate for vacation dates

Advantage:
- Automatic reassignment during absence
- No manual action needed
- Consistent coverage
- Items don't sit pending
```

**Best practice 2: Clear reassignment reasons**
```
Poor reason:
"Reassigning"

Good reason:
"Reassigning to Finance Manager - this request involves 
finance-specific SOX compliance requirements that require 
specialized knowledge to evaluate properly."

Advantage:
- Audit trail clarity
- New approver understands context
- Training opportunity
- Compliance evidence
```

**Best practice 3: Bulk operations for common scenarios**
```
Scenario: New team member onboarding

Instead of:
- Individual forwards for 50 onboarding requests

Better:
- Create approval rule: "If requestedItem = 'New Hire Access' 
  AND department = 'Sales' → Assign to onboarding.team"
- Bulk forward existing items
- Future requests auto-route correctly

Advantage:
- One-time bulk action
- Prevents future reassignments
- Systemic fix vs. repetitive manual work
```

---

### Troubleshooting Reassignment Issues

#### Issue 1: Reassignment Loops

**Problem:**
```
Work item ping-pongs between approvers
manager.smith → manager.jones → manager.smith → manager.jones...
```

**Root cause:**
```
Neither approver wants to make decision
Each forwards back to the other
No clear ownership
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Admin intervention: Assign to governance group
2. Escalate to both approvers' manager
3. Review approval scheme (may be misconfigured)
4. Add max reassignment limit (prevents loops)
5. Training: Explain approval responsibilities
```

---

#### Issue 2: Lost Work Items

**Problem:**
```
Work item forwarded but new approver can't find it
Requester sees "Pending" but no one is reviewing
```

**Root cause:**
```
Option A: Forwarded to inactive identity
Option B: Forwarded to identity without "My Work" access
Option C: Work item filtered out in new approver's view
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Admin search: Find work item by request ID
2. Check assignment: Verify current approver
3. Verify approver active and has access
4. Manually reassign if needed
5. Add validation: Prevent forward to invalid approver
```

---

#### Issue 3: Reassignment Without Authority

**Problem:**
```
User reassigned work item they don't own
System allowed it erroneously
```

**Root cause:**
```
Permission misconfiguration
User has admin rights unintentionally
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Review user's roles and permissions
2. Remove excessive permissions
3. Audit other reassignments by this user
4. Implement reassignment approval for non-owners
5. Add permission validation before reassignment
```

---

### Exam Tips

**Key concepts tested:**
✅ Forward vs. Reassign vs. Delegate differences
✅ When to use each reassignment type
✅ Reassignment permissions (who can reassign what)
✅ Audit trail components
✅ Bulk reassignment procedures
✅ Delegation workflow
✅ Reassignment restrictions and limits

**Common exam scenarios:**
- Choose correct reassignment method for scenario
- Identify who can reassign which work items
- Troubleshoot reassignment loops
- Interpret reassignment audit trail
- Determine if reassignment is allowed
- Configure delegation for expert review

**Remember:**
- Forward = permanent transfer, no recall
- Reassign = temporary transfer, can recall
- Delegate = advisory, retain authority
- Approvers can reassign own items
- Admins can reassign any items
- Audit trail tracks all reassignments
- Max chain length prevents loops
- Cannot reassign to inactive identities

---

### Key Takeaways

✅ **Three methods** - Forward (permanent), Reassign (recall), Delegate (advisory)

✅ **Forward use** - Wrong approver, routing error, permanent change

✅ **Reassign use** - Vacation coverage, workload distribution, temporary transfer

✅ **Delegate use** - Expert opinion, training, retain authority

✅ **Permissions** - Approvers (own), Managers (team), Admins (all)

✅ **Audit trail** - Complete reassignment history preserved

✅ **Restrictions** - Max chain length, time limits, invalid targets prevented

✅ **Best practice** - Clear reasons, proactive setup, bulk operations
