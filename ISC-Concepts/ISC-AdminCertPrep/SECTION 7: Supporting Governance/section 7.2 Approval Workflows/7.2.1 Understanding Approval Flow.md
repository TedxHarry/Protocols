## 7.2: Access Certifications

### 7.2.1: Certification Campaign Fundamentals

### Overview
Access certifications (also called access reviews or attestations) are periodic reviews where designated reviewers verify that users still require their current access. Certifications are a cornerstone of identity governance, ensuring compliance with regulations and reducing access creep over time.

**What you'll learn:**
- Purpose and benefits of certifications
- Campaign lifecycle phases
- Campaign types and when to use each
- Reviewer roles and responsibilities
- Certification decisions and their impact
- Campaign scheduling strategies
- Compliance requirements

### Purpose of Access Certifications

#### Why Certify Access?

**Primary objectives:**

**1. Compliance and audit requirements**
```
Regulatory drivers:
- SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley): Financial systems access
- HIPAA: Healthcare data access
- PCI-DSS: Payment card data access
- GDPR: Personal data access
- SOC 2: Security control evidence

Requirement: Regular attestation that access is appropriate
Evidence: Signed-off certification reports
Frequency: Quarterly, semi-annual, or annual
```

**2. Reduce access creep**
```
Problem: Users accumulate access over time
Causes:
- Job changes (new role, keep old access)
- Project work (temporary becomes permanent)
- Forgotten access (no longer needed)
- Acquisitions/reorganizations

Solution: Regular reviews identify and remove unnecessary access
Result: Principle of least privilege maintained
```

**3. Identify orphaned accounts**
```
Problem: Accounts for terminated/transferred users remain active
Risk: Unauthorized access, compliance violations
Detection: Certification reveals accounts without valid owner
Remediation: Disable/delete orphaned accounts
```

**4. Validate role assignments**
```
Purpose: Ensure role-based access still appropriate
Questions reviewers answer:
- Does this person still need this role?
- Is the role definition still correct?
- Are there better roles available?

Outcome: Role assignments aligned with actual job functions
```

**5. Detect policy violations**
```
Detection opportunities:
- Separation of Duties (SoD) violations
- Excessive privileges
- Inappropriate access combinations
- Unauthorized access grants

Action: Reviewers can revoke violating access
Result: Policy compliance restored
```

7. Campaign Completion
```

---

#### Phase 1: Planning & Configuration

**Configuration decisions:**

**Scope definition:**
```
What to certify:
- All identities vs. specific population
- All access vs. specific roles/entitlements
- Single source vs. multiple sources
- Role composition vs. access assignments

Examples:
- "Certify all access for Finance department"
- "Certify privileged access across all systems"
- "Certify Salesforce source owner access"
- "Certify all contractor access"
```

**Reviewer assignment:**
```
Who will review:
- Managers: Certify direct reports' access
- Source Owners: Certify access to their applications
- Role Owners: Certify who has their roles
- Governance Groups: Certify high-risk access

Assignment logic:
- Automatic: Based on relationships (manager, owner)
- Manual: Admin selects specific reviewers
- Fallback: If primary reviewer unavailable
```

**Schedule configuration:**
```
Timing decisions:
- Start date
- Active period duration (14-30 days typical)
- Challenge period duration (7-14 days)
- Revocation deadline
- Reminder schedule (Day 7, Day 14, etc.)

Example schedule:
Start: March 1
Active: 21 days (March 1-21)
Challenge: 7 days (March 22-28)
Revocation: 14 days (March 29 - April 11)
Complete: April 12
```

**Notification configuration:**
```
Email notifications:
- Campaign launch (to reviewers)
- Reminder emails (at milestones)
- Overdue notices (if not signed off)
- Completion confirmation
- Revocation notices (to affected users)

Templates: Customizable per organization
```

---

#### Phase 2: Campaign Generation

**What happens during generation:**

**Step 1: Data collection**
```
ISC gathers:
1. Identities in scope
2. Their access (roles, access profiles, entitlements)
3. Reviewer assignments
4. Supporting information (last login, risk score, etc.)

Example:
Campaign: "Q1 2024 Manager Certification"
Scope: All active employees
Data collected:
- 5,247 identities
- 142,356 access items
- 487 managers as reviewers
```

**Step 2: Certification item creation**
```
For each identity:
  For each access item:
    Create certification item:
    {
      "identity": "john.smith",
      "access": "VPN Access (Role)",
      "source": "Active Directory",
      "reviewer": "mike.manager",
      "decision": "Pending",
      "lastCertified": "2023-12-15",
      "riskLevel": "Medium"
    }

Total certification items = Identities × Avg Access Items
Example: 1,000 identities × 27 avg items = 27,000 items to review
```

**Step 3: Work item distribution**
```
Create work items for reviewers:
- Each reviewer gets work item(s)
- Work items contain all certifications they must review
- Work items appear in "My Work" section
- Email notification sent to each reviewer

Example work item:
Reviewer: Mike Manager
Certifications: 156 items
  - 12 direct reports
  - Average 13 access items per report
  - Total: 12 × 13 = 156 decisions needed
```

**Step 4: Campaign activation**
```
Campaign status: Active
Reviewers notified: Yes
Start date reached: Yes
Access to campaign: Reviewers can now access
Deadline: Active period end date

Campaign is now in review phase
```

---

#### Phase 3: Active Review Period

**During this phase, reviewers make decisions.**

**Reviewer access:**
```
Reviewers log in to ISC
Navigate to: My Work → Certifications
See: List of active certifications assigned to them

Example view:
My Certifications (3 campaigns):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Q1 2024 Manager Certification               │
│ Status: In Progress                         │
│ Items: 156 total, 89 pending, 67 decided   │
│ Due: March 21, 2024                        │
│ [Continue Review]                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Review interface:**
```
Certification details:

```

**Supporting information provided:**
```
For each certification item:
- Access name and description
- Source application
- Risk level/score
- Last login date (if available)
- When last certified
- Who approved previously
- Business justification (if provided)
- Related access (context)

Purpose: Help reviewer make informed decision
```

---

**Reviewer decisions:**

**1. Approve (Certify)**
```
Decision: Access is still appropriate
Action: Click "Approve" button
Effect:
- Item marked as certified/approved
- No change to user's access
- Compliance record created
- Item removed from pending list

Bulk approve:
- Select multiple items
- Click "Approve Selected"
- All selected items certified at once
```

**2. Revoke**
```
Decision: Access no longer appropriate
Action: Click "Revoke" button
Required: Revocation reason (comment)
Effect:
- Item marked for revocation
- Access will be removed during remediation phase
- User will be notified
- Item removed from pending list

Example reason: "User changed departments, no longer needs sales access"
```

**3. Reassign**
```
Decision: Different reviewer should decide
Action: Click "Reassign" button
Required: Target reviewer, reason
Effect:
- Item reassigned to different reviewer
- Original reviewer no longer responsible
- New reviewer notified
- Item removed from original reviewer's list

Example: "Reassigning to application owner for technical validation"
```

**4. Request Information**
```
Decision: Need more info to decide
Action: Click "Request Information" button
Required: Question for identity or admin
Effect:
- Item flagged for information request
- Requester notified
- Item remains in reviewer's list
- Can decide after receiving response

Example: "Why does this contractor still need admin access?"
```

**5. No Decision (Pending)**
```
Action: No action taken
Status: Item remains pending
Warning: Counts against completion
Escalation: Reminder emails sent
Timeout: If not decided by deadline, auto-action taken

Auto-action options (configurable):
- Auto-approve (risky, not recommended)
- Auto-revoke (conservative)
- Escalate to manager
- Leave pending (manual follow-up needed)
```

---

#### Phase 4: Sign-Off

**Completing the review:**

**Sign-off requirement:**
```
Before campaign can proceed:
- Reviewer must make decisions on ALL items
- Reviewer must click "Sign Off" button
- Sign-off = attestation that review is complete

Sign-off effect:
- Locks all decisions (no further changes)
- Removes work item from reviewer's list
- Records sign-off timestamp and reviewer
- Enables campaign to proceed to next phase
```

**Sign-off attestation:**
```
When clicking "Sign Off":

Confirmation dialog:
"By signing off, you attest that:
✓ You have reviewed all assigned access
✓ Your decisions are complete and accurate
✓ You understand revocations will be processed
✓ No further changes can be made after sign-off

Are you sure you want to sign off?
[Cancel] [Confirm Sign-Off]"

Legal significance: Creates compliance record
Auditor evidence: Signed attestation by reviewer
```

**Incomplete sign-off:**
```
If reviewer tries to sign off with pending items:

Error message:
"Cannot sign off - you have 23 pending decisions.
Please review all items before signing off.

[View Pending Items] [Cancel]"

Requirement: 100% decision completion before sign-off
```

---

#### Phase 5: Challenge Period (Optional)

**Purpose:** Allow affected users to contest revocation decisions

**When enabled:**
```
Starts: After all reviewers sign off
Duration: 7-14 days (configurable)
Eligible: Users whose access is being revoked

User notification:
"Your access to [Item] has been revoked in the Q1 Certification.
If you believe this is an error, you may challenge this decision
by [Challenge deadline].

[Challenge This Decision]"
```

**Challenge process:**
```
User clicks "Challenge":
1. Opens challenge form
2. User provides justification
3. Challenge routed to reviewer or escalation point
4. Reviewer reconsiders decision
5. Reviewer can:
   - Uphold revocation (deny challenge)
   - Overturn revocation (approve challenge)
6. User notified of final decision
```

**Challenge not enabled:**
```
If challenge period disabled:
- No opportunity to contest
- Revocations proceed immediately after sign-off
- Faster campaign completion
- Higher risk of erroneous revocations

Recommendation: Enable for high-impact campaigns
```

---

#### Phase 6: Remediation/Revocation

**Processing revocation decisions:**

**Revocation plan creation:**
```
For each revoked item:
  Create provisioning plan:
  {
    "operation": "Remove",
    "identity": "john.smith",
    "access": "VPN Access",
    "entitlements": ["VPN-Users", "Remote-Desktop-Users"],
    "source": "Active Directory",
    "reason": "Revoked in Q1 2024 Manager Certification",
    "revokedBy": "mike.manager",
    "revokedDate": "2024-03-21"
  }

All revoked items aggregated into remediation plan
```

**Revocation execution:**
```
Two execution modes:

Mode 1: Automatic revocation
  - ISC automatically provisions removals
  - Same process as access request provisioning
  - Direct API calls to target systems
  - Immediate execution after challenge period (or sign-off)
  - User access removed without manual intervention

Mode 2: Manual revocation
  - ISC creates tickets/work items for admins
  - Admins manually remove access
  - Admins close tickets when complete
  - ISC updates campaign when tickets closed
  - Slower but allows human verification
```

**User notification:**
```
Email to affected users:

Subject: Access Revoked - Q1 2024 Certification

The following access has been removed as a result of the
quarterly access certification:

Access Revoked:
- VPN Access (Role)
  - Includes: VPN-Users, Remote-Desktop-Users

Revoked By: Mike Manager (Your Manager)
Revoked Date: March 21, 2024
Reason: "User changed departments, no longer remote worker"

If you still require this access:
1. Contact your manager
2. Submit new access request with business justification

Questions? Contact IT Support at x5555
```

**Revocation timeline:**
```
Typical timeline:
Sign-off: March 21
Challenge period: March 22-28 (7 days)
Revocation: March 29 (automatic)
Access removed: March 29-30
Verification: March 31 (aggregation confirms removal)
Campaign complete: April 1

Total campaign duration: ~30 days
```

### Exam Tips

**Key concepts tested:**
✅ Certification lifecycle phases
✅ Campaign types and appropriate use cases
✅ Reviewer decisions and their effects
✅ Sign-off requirement and attestation
✅ Remediation/revocation process
✅ Challenge period purpose
✅ Compliance benefits

**Common exam scenarios:**
- Choose appropriate campaign type for scenario
- Identify current phase of campaign
- Determine who should be reviewer
- Explain what happens after sign-off
- Calculate campaign timeline
- Troubleshoot incomplete certifications

**Remember:**
- Seven lifecycle phases (Planning → Complete)
- Active phase = reviewers make decisions
- Sign-off required before remediation
- Revocations processed after sign-off (or challenge)
- Manager certs = broadest coverage
- Source owner = application-specific
- Role composition = validate role definitions
- Challenge period = users contest revocations

---

### Key Takeaways

✅ **Purpose** - Compliance, reduce access creep, validate access appropriateness

✅ **Seven phases** - Planning, Generation, Active, Sign-Off, Challenge, Remediation, Completion

✅ **Four main decisions** - Approve, Revoke, Reassign, Request Information

✅ **Sign-off critical** - Locks decisions, enables remediation, creates attestation

✅ **Six campaign types** - Manager, Source Owner, Role Composition, Identity, Access Item, Uncorrelated

✅ **Automatic remediation** - Revocations provisioned like access requests

✅ **Compliance evidence** - Signed attestations, decision records, completion reports

✅ **Challenge period** - Optional, allows users to contest revocations
