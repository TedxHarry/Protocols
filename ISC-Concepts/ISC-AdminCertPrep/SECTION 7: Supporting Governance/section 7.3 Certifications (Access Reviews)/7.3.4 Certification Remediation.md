Remediation is the process of executing revocation decisions made during certification campaigns. Understanding remediation methods, verification procedures, troubleshooting, and completion is essential for successful certification outcomes.

**What you'll learn:**
- Remediation triggers and initiation
- Automatic vs manual remediation
- Revocation verification methods
- Failed remediation handling

- Compliance reporting

---

### Remediation Initiation

**Trigger conditions:**
```
Remediation begins when:
✓ All reviewers signed off
✓ Challenge period ended (if enabled)
✓ Campaign reaches remediation phase

Example timeline:
- Sign-offs complete: March 21
- Challenge period: March 22-28
- Remediation starts: March 29
```

**Revocation summary:**
```
Campaign: Q1 2024 Contractor Certification

Items revoked: 324
After challenges: 318 (6 overturned)

Breakdown by source:
- Active Directory: 156 items
- Salesforce: 89 items
- SAP: 43 items
- Other applications: 30 items

Revocation reasons:
- Contract ended: 187 (58.8%)
- No longer needed: 76 (23.9%)
- Job change: 34 (10.7%)
- Excessive access: 21 (6.6%)
```

---

### Automatic Remediation

**Process flow:**
```
For each revoked item:

1. Create provisioning plan
   Operation: REMOVE
   Identity: affected user
   Access: revoked item
   
2. Execute via API
   Connect to target system
   Execute removal command
   
3. Verify removal
   Query target system
   Confirm access removed
   
4. Update status
   Mark as completed
   Timestamp recorded
```

**Example execution:**
```
Revoked: john.contractor - VPN Access role

Provisioning plan:
{
  "operation": "REMOVE",
  "identity": "john.contractor",
  "entitlements": [
    "AD:VPN-Users",
    "AD:Remote-Desktop-Users"
  ],
  "source": "Active Directory",
  "reason": "Revoked in Q1 2024 certification"
}

Execution:
Command: Remove-ADGroupMember
Target: VPN-Users, Remote-Desktop-Users  
User: john.contractor
Result: SUCCESS

Verification:
Query: Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "VPN-Users"
Result: john.contractor NOT in list ✓
Status: Verified removed

Duration: 2 minutes
```

---

### Manual Remediation (Ticketing)

**Process flow:**
```
For systems without API:

1. Create ticket
   System: ServiceNow
   Type: Revocation request
   
2. Assign to team
   Target: Application team
   
3. Manual removal
   Team removes access
   
4. Ticket closure
   Team closes when done
   
5. Status update
   ISC marks complete
```

**Example ticket:**
```
Ticket: SNOW-45678
Title: Revoke Access - Q1 Certification

Description:
Remove access for john.contractor per certification
revocation:

Access to remove:
- Mainframe RACF group: FINANCE_ADMIN
- Reason: Contract ended
- Revoked by: finance.manager
- Certification: Q1 2024 Contractor

Action required:
1. Remove user from RACF group
2. Verify removal
3. Close ticket with confirmation

Priority: Normal
Due date: April 5, 2024
Assigned to: Mainframe Team

Timeline:
Created: March 29
Assigned: March 29
In Progress: March 31
Completed: April 2
Closed: April 2

Result: Access removed, verified, documented
```

---

### Verification Methods

**Real-time verification:**
```
For automatic remediation:

Method: Immediate query after removal
Timing: Within seconds of removal

Process:
1. Execute removal command
2. Wait 10 seconds (propagation)
3. Query target system
4. Verify access not present
5. Mark verified

Example:
Removed from: Salesforce Sales User profile
Verification query: User.hasProfile('Sales User')
Result: FALSE ✓
Status: Verified
```

**Aggregation verification:**
```
For manual or delayed systems:

Method: Next scheduled aggregation
Timing: Hours to days after removal

Process:
1. Manual removal completed
2. Next aggregation runs
3. Access no longer discovered
4. ISC updates identity
5. Mark verified

Example:
Removed from: Mainframe group (manual)
Removal date: April 2
Next aggregation: April 3 (nightly)
Verification: April 3 - group not found
Status: Verified
```

### Handling Failed Remediation

**Common failures:**

**Failure 1: Account not found**
```
Error: "Cannot revoke - account jcontractor not found"

Causes:
- Account already deleted
- Account name mismatch
- Correlation broke

Resolution:
1. Verify account status
2. If deleted: Mark as complete (already gone)
3. If mismatch: Fix correlation, retry
4. Update certification status
```

**Failure 2: Permission denied**
```
Error: "Insufficient permissions to remove from group"

Causes:
- ISC service account lacks rights
- Protected group
- System-level restriction

Resolution:
1. Grant ISC account proper permissions
2. Or create manual ticket
3. Retry or escalate
4. Document for future
```

**Failure 3: Dependency error**
```
Error: "Cannot remove - required for other access"

Causes:
- Entitlement has dependencies
- Role includes entitlement
- Business logic prevents removal

Resolution:
1. Review dependencies
2. Remove dependent items first
3. Then remove primary item
4. Or override if appropriate
```

### Exam Tips

**Key concepts:**
✅ Remediation follows sign-off/challenge
✅ Automatic faster than manual
✅ Verification confirms removal
✅ Failed items need investigation
✅ Campaign completes after remediation
✅ Compliance report required

**Remember:**
- Automatic = API-based, immediate
- Manual = ticketing, slower
- Verification = confirm actually removed
- Failed removals need follow-up
- Complete audit trail preserved
- Reports prove compliance

---

### Key Takeaways

✅ **Remediation executes revocations** - Removes access from target systems

✅ **Two methods** - Automatic (API) or Manual (tickets)

✅ **Verification required** - Confirm access actually removed

✅ **Handle failures** - Investigate and resolve failed removals

✅ **Campaign completion** - All remediation processed

✅ **Compliance reporting** - Audit trail and evidence

✅ **Retention** - Preserve for regulatory requirements
