### Step 1-2: Type Selection and Basic Settings

**Campaign type selection:**
```
Navigate: Certifications → Create Campaign

Select type:
( ) Manager Certification
( ) Source Owner Certification
(•) Identity-Based (Search)
( ) Role Composition
( ) Access Item
( ) Uncorrelated Accounts

Selected: Identity-Based (most flexible)
```

**Basic configuration:**
```
Campaign Name: Q1 2024 Contractor Certification
  Best practice: Include period and purpose
  
Description: Quarterly review of all contractor access
             to ensure appropriate access levels and 
             remove access for completed contracts.
             
Tags: contractor, quarterly, compliance
  Purpose: Categorization and reporting
```

---

### Step 3: Scope Definition (Search-Based)

**Search query builder:**
```
For Identity-Based campaigns:

Field: employeeType
Operator: equals
Value: "Contractor"

AND

Field: lifecycle.state  
Operator: equals
Value: "Active"

Preview results: 347 identities

Example identities:
- john.contractor (Contract ends: 2024-06-30)
- jane.temp (Contract ends: 2024-04-15)
- bob.consultant (Contract ends: 2024-12-31)

Validation:
✓ Count matches expectations
✓ Sample identities are correct type
✓ No false positives detected
```

**Complex query example:**
```
Target: High-risk contractors in Finance

(employeeType = "Contractor" AND department = "Finance")
AND
(riskScore > 50 OR attributes.hasPrivilegedAccess = "true")
AND
lifecycle.state = "Active"

Preview: 23 identities

Refinement: Add business stakeholder review before launch
```

---

### Step 4: Schedule & Lifecycle Configuration

**Active period:**
```
Start date: March 1, 2024
Start time: 12:00 AM

End date: March 21, 2024  
End time: 11:59 PM

Duration: 21 days

Auto-actions on incomplete:
(•) Escalate to manager
( ) Auto-approve remaining items
( ) Auto-revoke remaining items
( ) Leave pending for admin review
```

**Challenge period:**
```
Enable challenge period: [✓] Yes

Start: Automatically after all sign-offs
Duration: 7 days

Challenge routing:
(•) Back to original reviewer
( ) To escalation approver
( ) To governance group
```

**Remediation period:**
```
Start: After challenge period ends
Deadline: 14 days after start
Method: (•) Automatic  ( ) Manual (ticketing)
```

---

### Step 5: Notifications & Reminders

**Launch notification:**
```
[✓] Email reviewers when campaign activates

Template: Campaign Launch
Customization:
  "You have been assigned to review contractor access
   as part of our quarterly compliance process."
```

**Reminder schedule:**
```
[✓] Day 7 - "14 days remaining"
[✓] Day 14 - "7 days remaining"  
[✓] Day 18 - "3 days remaining" (Priority: High)
[✓] Day 20 - "1 day remaining" (Priority: Urgent)

Escalation:
[✓] Day 21 - CC reviewer's manager if not signed off
```

---

### Step 6: Behavior Configuration

**Approval options:**
```
[✓] Allow bulk approve
[ ] Require comments on approve
[✓] Require comments on revoke

[✓] Allow delegation
[✓] Allow reassignment
```

**Auto-completion:**
```
Incomplete items at deadline:
(•) Escalate to fallback approver
( ) Auto-approve (not recommended)
( ) Auto-revoke (very conservative)

Fallback approver: governance.team
```

---

### Step 7-8: Preview and Validation

**Campaign preview:**
```
Preview shows:

Identities: 347
Reviewers: 89 (distinct managers)
Access items: 5,205

Top reviewers by volume:
1. manager.smith: 234 items (12 reports)
2. manager.jones: 187 items (9 reports)
3. manager.wilson: 156 items (8 reports)

Validation checks:
✓ All identities have valid managers
✓ No circular reviewer assignments
✓ Item counts reasonable
⚠ manager.smith has high volume - consider splitting
```

**Validation checklist:**
```
Before generation:

Configuration:
[✓] Campaign name descriptive
[✓] Scope query tested
[✓] Date ranges correct
[✓] Reviewers valid and active
[✓] Notifications configured
[✓] Fallback approvers assigned

Data quality:
[✓] Expected identity count
[✓] Reviewers not overloaded
[✓] No test/inactive identities included
[✓] Access items current (recent aggregation)

Stakeholder review:
[✓] Business sponsor approved
[✓] Compliance team notified
[✓] Reviewers pre-notified
```
