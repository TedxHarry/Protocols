### Certification Type Overview

#### Six Core Certification Types

| Type | Focus | Reviewer | Primary Use Case |
|------|-------|----------|------------------|
| Manager | All access per identity | Manager | Annual broad review |
| Source Owner | Application-specific | App owner | Application validation |
| Role Composition | Role definitions | Role owner | Role hygiene |
| Identity-Based | Specific population | Variable | Risk-based targeting |
| Access Item | Specific high-risk access | Item owner | Privileged access |
| Uncorrelated Accounts | Orphaned accounts | Source owner | Security cleanup |

---

### Type 1: Manager Certification

**Description:** Managers certify all access for their direct reports.

#### Configuration

**Scope:**
```
What's certified:
- All identities with a manager attribute
- All access (roles, access profiles, entitlements) for each identity
- Cross-application, comprehensive view

Example scope:
Population: All active employees
Filter: lifecycle.state = "Active" AND manager IS NOT NULL
Result: 5,247 identities
Items: ~78,915 total access items (15 avg per person)
```

**Reviewer assignment:**
```
Assignment logic:
For each identity:
  1. Read identity.manager attribute
  2. Assign that manager as reviewer
  3. Group all direct reports under manager

Example:
Manager: mike.manager
Direct reports: 12 employees
Items to review: 12 employees × 15 avg items = 180 items

Total reviewers: 487 managers
Avg items per manager: 162 items
```

#### When to Use Manager Certification

**Best for:**
```
✓ Annual/quarterly compliance reviews
✓ Broad access validation
✓ Business need verification
✓ SOX/regulatory requirements
✓ Post-reorganization cleanup
✓ Contractor/temporary worker reviews

Example scenarios:
- "Q1 2024 Annual Employee Certification"
- "Post-Merger Access Validation"
- "Contractor Quarterly Review"
```

**Advantages:**
```
✓ Managers know business context
  - Understand job requirements
  - Know if person still in role
  - Can assess business need

✓ Clear accountability
  - Manager responsible for team's access
  - Natural approval chain
  - Org structure alignment

✓ Comprehensive coverage
  - All access reviewed
  - Nothing missed
  - Complete audit trail

✓ Compliance friendly
  - Meets most regulatory requirements
  - Manager attestation valued by auditors
  - Standard practice
```

**Disadvantages:**
```
✗ Managers may lack technical knowledge
  - Don't understand application-specific entitlements
  - Can't assess technical appropriateness
  - May approve everything ("rubber stamp")

✗ Time-consuming for large teams
  - Managers with 50+ reports overwhelmed
  - 500+ items to review
  - Quality suffers

✗ Inconsistent reviews
  - Different managers, different standards
  - Some thorough, some quick approvals
  - Hard to ensure consistency
```

#### Example Manager Certification

**Scenario:**
```
Campaign: Q1 2024 Employee Annual Certification
Type: Manager
Scope: All active employees
Duration: 21 days active review

Results:
Identities: 5,247
Managers: 487
Items reviewed: 78,915
Items approved: 75,234 (95.3%)
Items revoked: 3,681 (4.7%)

Top revocation reasons:
1. "No longer in role requiring access" (42%)
2. "Project ended, access no longer needed" (28%)
3. "Moved to different department" (18%)
4. "Excessive/unused access" (12%)
```

---

### Type 2: Source Owner Certification

**Description:** Application owners certify all access to their applications.

#### Configuration

**Scope:**
```
What's certified:
- All access to specific source(s)
- All identities who have access to that source
- Application-focused view

Example scope:
Sources: Salesforce, SAP, Oracle Financials
Identities with access: 2,347 users
Items: All entitlements/roles for these 3 sources
Total items: ~9,400
```

**Reviewer assignment:**
```
Assignment logic:
For each source:
  1. Read source.owner attribute
  2. Assign that owner as reviewer for ALL access to source

Example:
Source: Salesforce
Owner: crm.admin
Reviews: All 847 users with Salesforce access
Items: 847 users × 4 avg Salesforce items = 3,388 items

Source: SAP
Owner: erp.admin  
Reviews: All 623 users with SAP access
Items: 623 users × 5 avg SAP items = 3,115 items
```

#### When to Use Source Owner Certification

**Best for:**
```
✓ Application-specific reviews
✓ Technical validation
✓ License compliance (who needs expensive licenses?)
✓ Application decommissioning prep
✓ Post-implementation validation
✓ High-value application governance

Example scenarios:
- "Salesforce License Optimization Review"
- "SAP Privileged Access Quarterly Review"
- "Oracle Financials SOX Compliance Certification"
```

**Advantages:**
```
✓ Technical expertise
  - Owners understand application
  - Know what entitlements mean
  - Can assess technical appropriateness

✓ Application context
  - See all users of application together
  - Can identify patterns/anomalies
  - Compare users side-by-side

✓ License optimization
  - Identify unused licenses
  - Reclaim expensive licenses

✓ Application security
  - Application owner accountable
  - Can enforce application policies
  - Better security posture
```

**Disadvantages:**
```
✗ Owners may not know business need
  - Don't know why user needs access
  - Can't assess job requirements
  - May need to consult managers

✗ High volume for popular apps
  - Popular apps = many users
  - 1,000+ items to review
  - Owner overwhelmed

✗ Potential conflict of interest
  - Owner wants to keep users (metrics)
  - May not revoke liberally
  - Political pressure

✗ Slower (more reviewers)
  - Each source has different owner
  - Multiple review cycles
  - Coordination challenges
```

#### Example Source Owner Certification

**Scenario:**
```
Campaign: Salesforce Q2 License Optimization
Type: Source Owner
Scope: All Salesforce access
Duration: 14 days active review

Configuration:
Source: Salesforce
Owner: crm.admin
Identities: 847 users
Items: 3,388 Salesforce entitlements

Results:
Items reviewed: 3,388
Items approved: 3,156 (93.1%)
Items revoked: 232 (6.9%)

Revocation analysis:
- Inactive users (no login 90+ days): 89 licenses reclaimed
- Users with redundant licenses: 67 downgrades
- Users who left company: 34 licenses reclaimed
- Contractors post-project: 42 licenses reclaimed

Financial impact:
Licenses reclaimed: 232
Cost per license: $150/month
Annual savings: 232 × $150 × 12 = $417,600
```

---

### Type 3: Role Composition Certification

**Description:** Role owners certify that role definitions and membership are correct.

#### Configuration

**Scope:**
```
What's certified:
- Specific roles (not individual user access)
- Role definition (entitlements included)
- Role membership (who should have role)
- Role metadata (owner, description, criteria)

Example scope:
Roles: All roles with "Admin" or "Privileged" in name
Result: 23 privileged roles
Focus: Are these roles still appropriate?
```

**Reviewer assignment:**
```
Assignment logic:
For each role:
  1. Read role.owner attribute
  2. Assign that owner as reviewer for role composition

Example:
Role: "Engineering Manager"
Owner: VP Engineering
Reviews:
  ✓ Role description still accurate?
  ✓ Included entitlements still appropriate?
  ✓ Membership criteria correct?
  ✓ All 23 members should still have role?

Decision options:
  - Approve role as-is (composition & members)
  - Approve but revoke specific members
  - Recommend role changes (modify entitlements)
  - Mark role for deletion (obsolete)
```

#### When to Use Role Composition Certification

**Best for:**
```
✓ Annual role validation
✓ Post-reorganization role review
✓ Role cleanup initiatives
✓ After significant access changes
✓ Role maturity programs
✓ Privilege creep prevention (at role level)

Example scenarios:
- "Annual Privileged Role Review"
- "Post-Merger Role Consolidation"
- "Engineering Department Role Validation"
```

**Advantages:**
```
✓ Role hygiene
  - Ensures roles stay accurate
  - Identifies obsolete roles
  - Validates membership criteria

✓ Efficient (fewer items)
  - 50 roles vs. 50,000 access items
  - Focused review
  - Role expert reviews

✓ Preventive control
  - Fix role before assigned to 100s of users
  - Systemic improvement
  - Reduces future access creep

✓ Role maturity
  - Improves role quality over time
  - Validates automated assignment
  - Ensures role-based model works
```

**Disadvantages:**
```
✗ Doesn't certify individual access
  - Reviews role definition, not user access
  - Misses individual exceptions
  - Complementary to other types, not replacement

✗ Requires role maturity
  - Organization must use roles effectively
  - If no roles, this type doesn't apply
  - Assumes roles are meaningful

✗ Can miss individual issues
  - User may have role + exceptions
  - Exceptions not reviewed here
  - Need combined approach
```

#### Example Role Composition Certification

**Scenario:**
```
Campaign: Annual Privileged Role Validation
Type: Role Composition
Scope: All roles with risk score > 70
Duration: 14 days active review

Configuration:
Roles in scope: 23 privileged roles
Reviewers: Role owners (varies per role)

Sample role reviewed:

Role: "Domain Admin"
Owner: Infrastructure Director
Current members: 8 identities
Entitlements: 12 high-privilege entitlements
Last modified: 18 months ago

Owner review questions:
1. Are these 12 entitlements still appropriate? ✓ Yes
2. Should these 8 people still have this role?
   - 6 approved ✓
   - 2 revoked ✗ ("No longer in infrastructure team")
3. Is description accurate? ✓ Yes
4. Are membership criteria correct? ✓ Yes

Results across all roles:
Roles reviewed: 23
Roles approved as-is: 18 (78%)
Roles with member revocations: 4 (17%)
Roles marked for modification: 1 (4%)
Roles marked for deletion: 0 (0%)

Members removed: 5 across 4 roles
Roles updated: 1 role definition changed
```

### Type 4: Identity-Based Certification

**Description:** Certify all access for specific identities selected by search query.

#### Configuration

**Scope:**
```
What's certified:
- Identities matching search criteria
- All access for those specific identities
- Targeted population

Example scopes:

Scenario 1: Contractor review
Search: employeeType = "Contractor"
Result: 347 contractors
Items: All access for these 347 identities

Scenario 2: High-risk users
Search: riskScore > 75
Result: 89 high-risk identities
Items: All access for these 89 identities

Scenario 3: Finance department
Search: department = "Finance"
Result: 234 finance employees
Items: All access for these 234 identities

Scenario 4: Privileged users
Search: attributes.privilegedUser = "true"
Result: 45 privileged identities
Items: All access for these 45 identities
```

**Reviewer assignment:**
```
Flexible assignment options:

Option A: Manager (like manager cert)
  Each identity's manager reviews their access

Type: Identity-Based (Search)
Scope: Identities with riskScore > 75
Duration: 21 days active review

Search configuration:
Query: identity.riskScore > 75 AND lifecycle.state = "Active"
Results: 89 identities flagged as high-risk

Risk factors contributing to high scores:
- Privileged access: 45 identities
- Excessive entitlements (>50 items): 28 identities
- SoD violations: 12 identities
- Inactive but enabled: 4 identities

Reviewer assignment:
Assigned to: Security Governance Team (specialized group)
Team size: 5 security analysts
Items per analyst: ~267 items (89 identities × 30 avg items ÷ 5)

Results:
Items reviewed: 2,670
Items approved: 2,234 (83.7%)
Items revoked: 436 (16.3%)

Risk reduction:
Average risk score before: 82.3
Average risk score after: 68.7
High-risk identities after cleanup: 34 (61% reduction)
```

### Type 5: Access Item Certification

**Description:** Certify who has specific high-risk or high-value access items.

#### Configuration

**Scope:**
```
What's certified:
- Specific access items (roles, APs, entitlements)
- Who has these items (reverse view)
- Focus on the access, not the identity

Example scopes:

Scenario 1: Admin roles
Items: All roles with "Admin" in name
Result: 15 admin roles
Question: Who should have each of these 15 roles?

Scenario 2: Expensive licenses
Items: All access profiles tagged "expensive-license"
Result: 8 expensive access profiles
Assignments: 456 users have these profiles

Scenario 3: SOX-critical entitlements
Items: Entitlements tagged "SOX-critical"
Result: 34 entitlements
Assignments: 892 users have these entitlements

Scenario 4: Privileged AD groups
Items: Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, Schema Admins
Result: 3 groups
Members: 12 users across these groups
```

**Reviewer assignment:**
```
Reviewer options:

Option A: Item owner
  Role owner reviews who has their role
  Most common approach

Option B: Governance group
  Security team reviews privileged access
  Use for high-risk items

Option C: Application owner
  For application-specific items
  Use for licensed or costly access

Example:
Item: "Domain Admin" role
Owner: Infrastructure Director
Certification shows: 8 users who have this role
Question for owner: Should each of these 8 still have it?

Review interface shows:
Domain Admin Role - 8 members
├─ admin.user1 ✓ Approve / ✗ Revoke
├─ admin.user2 ✓ Approve / ✗ Revoke
├─ admin.user3 ✓ Approve / ✗ Revoke
└─ ... (5 more)

Owner reviews each member individually
```

  - Other access not reviewed
  - Need complementary certifications

✗ Requires identification of critical items
  - Must know what's high-risk
  - Requires risk assessment
  - Ongoing maintenance

✗ Can be high volume for popular items
  - If 500 users have the item
  - Owner reviews 500 assignments
  - May still be overwhelming
```

#### Example Access Item Certification

**Scenario:**
```
Campaign: Monthly Privileged Access Review
Type: Access Item
Scope: Top 10 highest-risk roles
Duration: 7 days active review

Total assignments to review: 71

Reviewers:
Each role owner reviews their role's membership
10 different owners (some own multiple roles)

Results:
Assignments reviewed: 71
Assignments approved: 64 (90.1%)
Assignments revoked: 7 (9.9%)

Revocations:
- Domain Admin: 1 revoked (person changed roles)
- Production DBA: 2 revoked (project ended)
- Financial Approver: 3 revoked (moved to different dept)
- Network Admin: 1 revoked (contractor finished)

Outcome:
Critical privileged access validated

- Are they orphaned? (delete)
- Are they test accounts? (keep or delete)
```

**Reviewer assignment:**
```
Typically assigned to:
- Source owner
- Security team
- Governance group

Why: Requires technical knowledge to determine account purpose

Example:
Source: Active Directory

  - Coordination with teams
```

#### Example Uncorrelated Account Certification

**Scenario:**
```
Campaign: Q2 Active Directory Orphaned Account Review
Type: Uncorrelated Accounts
Scope: All AD accounts with no identity correlation
Duration: 14 days active review

Configuration:
Source: Active Directory
Uncorrelated accounts: 127
Reviewer: AD Admin Team

Review workflow:
For each account, determine category:

1. Service accounts (38 accounts):
   Decision: Keep
   Action: Document as service account
   Future: Create service identity, correlate properly

2. Should be correlated (23 accounts):
   Decision: Fix correlation
   Reason: Correlation rule missed them
   Action: Update correlation, re-aggregate

3. Orphaned - employees left (31 accounts):
   Decision: Delete
   Reason: Employee terminated, account orphaned
   Action: Disable immediately, delete after 30 days

4. Orphaned - contractors (18 accounts):
   Decision: Delete
   Reason: Contract ended, account not removed
   Action: Delete immediately

5. Test accounts (12 accounts):
   Decision: Delete or document
   Reason: Old test accounts, no longer needed
   Action: Delete 10, keep 2 documented test accounts

6. Unknown/investigate (5 accounts):
   Decision: Pending investigation
   Reason: Can't determine purpose
   Action: Escalate to senior admin

Results:
Total reviewed: 127
Service accounts documented: 38
Correlation fixed: 23
Deleted: 61
Pending investigation: 5

Security impact:
Orphaned accounts removed: 61
Attack surface reduced
Compliance improved

### Exam Tips

**Key concepts tested:**
✅ Six certification types and their purposes
✅ Reviewer assignment for each type
✅ When to use each type
✅ Advantages and disadvantages
✅ Combining certification types
