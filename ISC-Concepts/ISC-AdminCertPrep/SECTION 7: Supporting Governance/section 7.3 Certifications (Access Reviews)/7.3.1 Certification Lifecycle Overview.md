## 7.3: Certifications (Access Reviews)

### 7.3.1: Certification Lifecycle Overview

### Overview
Access certifications (also called access reviews or attestations) are periodic reviews where designated reviewers verify that users still require their current access. Understanding the complete certification lifecycle—from planning through completion—is essential for administrators, reviewers, and the certification exam.

**What you'll learn:**
- Purpose and benefits of certifications
- Complete certification lifecycle phases
- Phase transitions and timing
- Reviewer responsibilities per phase
- Sign-off requirements
- Remediation and revocation process
- Campaign completion and reporting

### Purpose of Access Certifications

#### Why Certify Access?

**Primary objectives:**

**1. Compliance and regulatory requirements**
```
Regulatory drivers:
- SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley): Financial systems access
- HIPAA: Healthcare data access  
- PCI-DSS: Payment card data access
- GDPR: Personal data access
- SOC 2: Security control evidence
- NIST, ISO 27001: Access control frameworks

Requirement: Periodic attestation that access is appropriate
Evidence: Signed-off certification reports
Frequency: Quarterly, semi-annual, or annual
Auditor question: "How do you verify access is appropriate?"
Answer: "Regular access certifications with documented approvals"
```

**2. Reduce access creep**
```
Problem: Users accumulate access over time without cleanup

Causes:
- Job changes: New role granted, old access retained
- Project work: Temporary access becomes permanent
- Forgotten access: No longer needed but never removed
- Acquisitions: Multiple account mergers
- Reorganizations: Department changes, access remains

Example timeline:
Year 1: User has 8 access items (appropriate)
Year 2: Job change, add 6 items, keep all 8 → 14 items
Year 3: Project work, add 4 items → 18 items
Year 4: Reorganization, add 5 items → 23 items
Result: 23 items, only 12 still needed

Solution: Annual certification removes 11 unnecessary items
Benefit: Return to principle of least privilege
```

**3. Identify orphaned and dormant accounts**
```
Orphaned accounts:
- Employee terminated, account remains active
- Contractor finished, access not revoked
- Service account owner left, account orphaned

Dormant accounts:
- Not used in 90+ days
- User has alternate account
- Functionality moved to different system

Detection: Certification reveals accounts without valid owner
Risk: Unauthorized access, backdoor entry, compliance violations
Remediation: Disable/delete orphaned accounts, review dormant accounts
```

**4. Validate role assignments**
```
Purpose: Ensure role-based access still appropriate

Questions reviewers answer:
- Does this person still need this role?
- Is this person still in same job function?
- Are role contents still correct?
- Should role be updated or person removed?

Outcomes:
- Role assignments aligned with current job
- Roles updated to reflect current needs
- Users removed from inappropriate roles
- Role definitions improved based on feedback
```

**5. Detect policy violations**
```
Policy violations detectable through certification:

Separation of Duties (SoD):
- User has incompatible access (e.g., requestor + approver)
- Detected: Certification shows both roles
- Action: Revoke one role to resolve conflict

Excessive privileges:
- User has more access than peers in same role
- Detected: Comparison during review
- Action: Remove excessive access

Unauthorized access:
- Access granted outside normal process
- Detected: No approval record, no birthright justification
- Action: Revoke and investigate how granted
```

```

---

### Phase 1: Planning & Configuration

**Purpose:** Define what will be certified, who will review, and how the campaign will operate.

**Key configuration decisions:**

**Decision 1: Scope definition**
```
What to certify:

Option A: All identities
  Scope: Every identity in ISC
  Items: All access for all identities
  Use: Annual comprehensive review

Option B: Specific population
  Scope: Search-based (e.g., contractors only)
  Items: All access for filtered identities
  Use: Targeted risk-based review

Option C: Specific access
  Scope: High-risk roles/entitlements
  Items: Who has these specific items
  Use: Privileged access review

Option D: Specific application
  Scope: Single source/application
  Items: All access to that application
  Use: Application-specific validation

Example scoping:
Campaign: "Q1 2024 Contractor Certification"
Scope: employeeType = "Contractor"
Result: 347 contractor identities
Items: ~5,200 access items to certify
```

**Decision 2: Reviewer assignment**
```
Who will review:

Strategy A: Manager certification
  Reviewer: Each identity's manager
  Assignment: Automatic (manager attribute)
  Use: Business need validation

Strategy B: Source owner certification
  Reviewer: Application/source owners
  Assignment: Automatic (source.owner)
  Use: Technical validation

Strategy C: Role owner certification
  Reviewer: Role owners
  Assignment: Automatic (role.owner)
  Use: Role membership validation

Strategy D: Governance group
  Reviewer: Designated review team
  Assignment: Manual selection
  Use: High-risk access, compliance reviews

Example assignment:
Campaign type: Manager
Reviewer assignment: Automatic (manager attribute)
Fallback: If no manager → Governance group
Result: 487 managers assigned as reviewers
```

**Decision 3: Schedule configuration**
```
Campaign timing:

Active period:
  Start date: March 1, 2024
  End date: March 21, 2024
  Duration: 21 days
  Purpose: Reviewers make decisions

Challenge period (optional):
  Start date: March 22, 2024
  End date: March 28, 2024
  Duration: 7 days
  Purpose: Users contest revocations

Remediation period:
  Start date: March 29, 2024
  Deadline: April 12, 2024
  Duration: 14 days
  Purpose: Execute revocations

Reminders:
  Day 7: First reminder
  Day 14: Second reminder
  Day 18: Final reminder
  Day 20: Escalation warning
```

**Decision 4: Behavior settings**
```
Campaign behaviors:

Bulk approve:
  [✓] Allow bulk approval
  Benefit: Efficiency for standard access
  Risk: Less careful review

Bulk revoke:
  [ ] Allow bulk revocation
  Benefit: None (risky)
  Risk: Accidental mass revocation

Comments:
  Require on approval: [ ] Optional
  Require on revocation: [✓] Required
  Benefit: Audit trail, justification

Delegation:
  [✓] Allow reviewers to delegate
  [✓] Allow reassignment
  Benefit: Flexibility for vacations

Auto-completion:
  [ ] Auto-approve pending items at deadline
  [✓] Escalate incomplete to manager
  Benefit: Ensures all items reviewed
```

### Phase 2: Campaign Generation

**Purpose:** Create certification items and assign to reviewers.

**Generation process:**

**Step 1: Data collection**
```
ISC gathers certification data:

1. Identities in scope
   Query: employeeType = "Contractor"
   Result: 347 identities

2. Access for each identity
   Query: All roles, access profiles, entitlements
   Result: ~15 items per identity avg

3. Reviewer assignments
   Lookup: manager attribute for each identity
   Result: 89 unique managers

4. Supporting metadata
   Collect: Last login, risk scores, last certified date
   Purpose: Help reviewers make informed decisions

Total items generated: 347 identities × 15 items = 5,205 items
```

**Step 2: Certification item creation**
```
For each identity + access combination, create item:

Certification item structure:
{
  "certificationId": "CERT-2024-Q1-001",
  "itemId": "ITEM-12345",
  "identity": {
    "id": "2c91808a...",
    "name": "john.contractor",
    "displayName": "John Contractor"
  },
  "access": {
    "type": "ROLE",
    "name": "VPN Access",
    "id": "2c91808b...",
    "source": "Active Directory"
  },
  "reviewer": "mike.manager",
  "decision": "PENDING",
  "metadata": {
    "lastLogin": "2024-02-10",
    "riskScore": 35,
    "lastCertified": "2023-03-15"
  }
}

Total items created: 5,205
Grouped by reviewer: 89 managers
Avg items per reviewer: 58 items
```

**Step 3: Campaign activation**
```
Campaign activated:

Status change: Draft → Active
Reviewers notified: 89 email notifications sent
Work items created: 89 work items (one per reviewer)
Start date: March 1, 2024, 12:00 AM
Active period ends: March 21, 2024, 11:59 PM

Notification email to reviewers:
"You have been assigned to review 58 access items in the
Q1 2024 Contractor Certification campaign. Please complete
your review by March 21, 2024."

Campaign now accessible for review
```

---

### Phase 3: Active Review Period

**Purpose:** Reviewers examine access and make certification decisions.

**Reviewer workflow:**

**Step 1: Access campaign**
```
Reviewer login: mike.manager
Navigate: My Work → Certifications
See: Q1 2024 Contractor Certification

Campaign card:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Q1 2024 Contractor Certification        │

│    Last certified: 1 year ago              │
│    [Approve] [Revoke] [Reassign]          │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Reviewer evaluates each item:
- Is access still needed for job?
- Is person still in contractor role?
- Is access being actively used?
- Does access align with job function?
```

**Step 3: Make decisions**
```
Decision options:

1. Approve (Certify):
   Meaning: Access is appropriate, keep it
   Action: Click "Approve"
   Comment: Optional
   Effect: Item marked approved, no access change

2. Revoke:
   Meaning: Access no longer appropriate, remove it
   Action: Click "Revoke"
   Comment: Required
   Effect: Marked for revocation, access removed later
   Example: "Contract ended, access no longer needed"

3. Reassign:
   Meaning: Different reviewer should decide
   Action: Click "Reassign", select new reviewer
   Comment: Required
   Effect: Item moved to different reviewer
   Example: "Reassigning to project manager for validation"

4. Leave Pending:
   Meaning: Need more information or time
   Action: No action yet
   Effect: Remains in pending state
   Risk: Must decide before deadline

Bulk actions available:
- Select multiple items
- Approve all selected (if allowed)
- Review by identity (all items for one person)
```

**Step 4: Progress tracking**
```
Reviewer dashboard shows:

Total items: 58
Approved: 35 (60%)
Revoked: 12 (21%)
Reassigned: 3 (5%)
Pending: 8 (14%)

Time remaining: 7 days
Last activity: 2 hours ago

Recommendation: Complete 8 remaining items soon
Reminder scheduled: Day 18 (in 4 days)
```

---

### Phase 4: Sign-Off

**Purpose:** Reviewers attest that their review is complete and accurate.

**Sign-off requirement:**

**Pre-requisite: All items must have decisions**
```
Before sign-off allowed:
✓ All items approved, revoked, or reassigned
✗ No items can remain pending

If pending items exist:
Error: "Cannot sign off - you have 8 pending decisions.
        Please review all items before signing off."

Reviewer must: Decide on all 8 remaining items

- Contact administrator
- Admin can reopen certification (special circumstances)
- Audit trail will show reopening
```

**Campaign-wide sign-off tracking:**
```
Campaign status:

Assigned reviewers: 89
Signed off: 67 (75%)
Pending sign-off: 22 (25%)

Campaign cannot proceed to next phase until:
All 89 reviewers have signed off
OR
Active period end date reached (auto-action on incomplete)
```

---

### Phase 5: Challenge Period (Optional)

**Purpose:** Allow affected users to contest revocation decisions.

**When challenge period is enabled:**
```
Trigger: All reviewers signed off
Start: Automatically after last sign-off
Duration: 7 days (configurable)
Eligible: Only users whose access is being revoked

Example:
All reviewers signed off: March 21, 2024
Challenge period starts: March 22, 2024
Challenge period ends: March 28, 2024
```

**Challenge workflow:**

**Step 1: User notification**
```
Email to affected users:

Subject: Access Revocation - Challenge Period Available

Your access to the following items has been revoked in
the Q1 2024 Contractor Certification:

Items to be revoked:
- VPN Access (Role)
- Remote Desktop Access (Access Profile)

Revoked by: Mike Manager (Your Manager)
Revocation date: March 21, 2024
Reason: "Contract ended, access no longer appropriate"

If you believe this revocation is an error, you may
challenge this decision by March 28, 2024.

[Challenge This Revocation] [Accept Revocation]

If no challenge submitted, access will be removed on
March 29, 2024.
```

**Step 2: User submits challenge**
```
User clicks "Challenge This Revocation"

Challenge form:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Challenge Revocation Decision               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Items being challenged:                     │
│ • VPN Access                                │
│ • Remote Desktop Access                     │
│                                             │
│ Justification for challenge (required):    │
│ [Text box]                                  │
│                                             │
│ Example: "My contract was extended for 6   │
│ more months starting April 1. I still need │
│ this access to complete the project."      │
│                                             │
│ Supporting documentation (optional):        │
│ [Upload contract extension]                │
│                                             │
│ [Cancel] [Submit Challenge]                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Step 3: Challenge review**
```
Challenge routed to: Original reviewer (mike.manager)

Reviewer notification:
"John Contractor has challenged your revocation decision
in Q1 2024 Contractor Certification."

Reviewer options:
1. Uphold revocation (deny challenge):
   - Revocation proceeds as planned
   - User notified
   - Access removed during remediation

2. Overturn revocation (approve challenge):
   - Revocation canceled
   - Access retained
   - User notified
   - Audit trail updated

3. Request more information:
   - Ask questions
   - Request additional documentation
   - Delay decision until clarified

Reviewer decision on this challenge:
Decision: Overturn revocation
Reason: "Contract extension verified, access still needed
         through September 2024. Updating notes."

Result: User keeps access, revocation canceled
```

**Challenge period statistics:**
```
Campaign: Q1 2024 Contractor Certification

Total revocations: 324 items
Challenges received: 18 (5.6%)
Challenges upheld (revocation proceeded): 12 (67%)
Challenges approved (revocation canceled): 6 (33%)

Common challenge reasons:
- Contract extension: 8 challenges
- Still working on project: 5 challenges
- Access incorrectly identified: 3 challenges
- Manager misunderstood role: 2 challenges
```

**When challenge period is NOT enabled:**
```
Configuration: Challenge period disabled

Flow:
All reviewers sign off → Remediation begins immediately
No opportunity for users to contest
Faster campaign completion
Higher risk of legitimate access being revoked

Use cases for disabling:
- Low-risk access reviews
- Time-sensitive campaigns
- High confidence in reviewer decisions
- Previously had challenge period, revocations well-vetted
```

---

### Phase 6: Remediation/Revocation

**Purpose:** Execute revocation decisions by removing access from target systems.

**Remediation initiation:**
```
Trigger: Challenge period ends (or immediate if disabled)
Start date: March 29, 2024
Items to revoke: 318 items (324 original - 6 challenges approved)
```

**Revocation plan creation:**
```
For each revoked item, ISC creates provisioning plan:

Example revoked item:
Identity: john.contractor
Access: VPN Access (Role)
Revoked by: mike.manager
Revocation reason: "Contract ended"

Provisioning plan generated:
{
  "operation": "REMOVE",
  "planId": "PP-REVOKE-2024-00123",
  "certificationId": "CERT-2024-Q1-001",
  "identity": "john.contractor",
  "access": {
    "type": "ROLE",
    "name": "VPN Access",
    "entitlements": [
      "AD:VPN-Users",
      "AD:Remote-Desktop-Users"
    ]
  },
  "reason": "Revoked in Q1 2024 Contractor Certification",
  "revokedBy": "mike.manager",
  "revokedDate": "2024-03-21"
}

All 318 items aggregated into revocation batch
```

**Revocation execution methods:**

**Method 1: Automatic revocation (preferred)**
```
Process:
1. ISC connects to target systems
2. Executes removal commands via API
3. Verifies removal
4. Updates certification status

Example (Active Directory):
Command: Remove-ADGroupMember
Parameters: {
  Identity: "VPN-Users",
  Members: "john.contractor"
}
Execution: Immediate
Verification: LDAP query confirms removal
Status: Success

Timeline:
Start: March 29, 2024
Automatic execution: March 29-30, 2024
Verification: March 31, 2024
Completion: March 31, 2024

Advantages:
✓ Fast (1-2 days)
✓ Immediate execution
✓ Automatic verification
✓ Real-time status updates
```

**Method 2: Manual revocation (ticketing)**
```
Process:
1. ISC creates tickets in service desk
2. Tickets assigned to application teams
3. Teams manually revoke access
4. Teams close tickets when complete
5. ISC updates certification status

Example (Legacy mainframe):
Ticket created: SNOW-12345
Title: "Revoke access - Certification Q1 2024"
Description: "Remove john.contractor from RACF group
             SYSADMIN per certification revocation"
Assigned to: Mainframe Team
Priority: Normal

Manual steps:
Day 1: Ticket created and assigned
Day 3: Mainframe team reviews
Day 5: Access manually removed
Day 6: Ticket closed with notes
Day 7: ISC marks item complete

Timeline:
Start: March 29, 2024
Ticket creation: March 29, 2024
Manual processing: March 29 - April 5, 2024
Completion: April 5, 2024

Advantages:
✓ Works for any system
✓ Human verification
✗ Slower (5-14 days)
✗ Manual effort required
```

**User notification:**
```
Email to affected user:

Subject: Access Revoked - Q1 2024 Certification

Your access to the following items has been removed as a
result of the Q1 2024 Contractor Certification campaign:

Access Revoked:
- VPN Access (Role)
  - VPN-Users group (Active Directory)
  - Remote-Desktop-Users group (Active Directory)

Revoked by: Mike Manager
Revoked date: March 21, 2024
Reason: "Contract ended, access no longer appropriate"
Removal date: March 30, 2024

You no longer have access to:
- Corporate VPN
- Remote desktop connections

If you still require this access:
1. Verify your contract status with HR
2. If contract extended, contact your manager
3. Submit new access request with updated justification

Questions? Contact IT Support at x5555
```

**Revocation verification:**
```
ISC verifies revocations:

Method 1: Real-time verification (automatic revocation)
- Query target system immediately after removal
- Confirm access no longer present
- Mark as verified

Method 2: Aggregation verification (manual revocation)
- Next scheduled aggregation discovers removal
- Entitlement no longer associated with identity
- Mark as verified

Verification status tracking:
Total revocations: 318
Successfully removed: 312 (98.1%)
Failed removals: 6 (1.9%)
Pending verification: 0

Failed removal handling:
- Admin notified
- Manual investigation required
- May need manual cleanup
- Retry or escalate
```

**Completion criteria:**
```
Campaign can complete when:
✓ All reviewers signed off
✓ Challenge period ended (if enabled)

### Exam Tips

**Key concepts tested:**
✅ Seven lifecycle phases in order
✅ Purpose of each phase
✅ Sign-off requirement and attestation
✅ Challenge period purpose and workflow
✅ Remediation methods (automatic vs. manual)
✅ Completion criteria
✅ Compliance reporting requirements

**Common exam scenarios:**
- Identify current phase of certification
- Determine what happens after sign-off
- Explain challenge period purpose
- Calculate campaign timeline
- Troubleshoot incomplete certifications
- Interpret completion statistics

**Remember:**
- Seven phases: Planning → Generation → Active → Sign-Off → Challenge → Remediation → Completion
- Active phase = reviewers make decisions
- Sign-off = attestation, locks decisions
- Challenge period = optional, users contest revocations
- Remediation = execute revocations
- All reviewers must sign off before next phase
- Complete audit trail preserved for compliance
