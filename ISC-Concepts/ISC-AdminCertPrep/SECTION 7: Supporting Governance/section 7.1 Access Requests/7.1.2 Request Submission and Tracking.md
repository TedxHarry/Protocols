### User Experience Optimization

#### Best Practices for Users

**1. Descriptive justification**
```
Poor: "Need for work"
Good: "Need VPN access to work remotely 3 days/week per 
       new flexible work policy effective March 2024"

Why: Helps approvers make informed decisions quickly
```

**2. Request related items together**
```
Instead of:
- Request 1: Role A
- Request 2: Role B (related to A)
- Request 3: Access Profile C (related to A & B)

Better:
- Single request: Role A, Role B, Access Profile C

Why: 
- Single approval cycle
- Faster overall
- Better context for approver
```

**3. Check existing access first**
```
Before requesting:
My Access → Search for item
If already have → Don't request
If don't have → Proceed with request

Why: Avoids duplicate request rejections
```

**4. Monitor request proactively**
```
Don't just wait for emails:
- Check My Requests daily if urgent
- Add comments if delays
- Follow up with approver if past SLA

Why: Ensures timely access for time-sensitive needs
```

**5. Save frequently requested items**
```
Item Details → Add to Favorites ⭐
Next time:
Catalog → Favorites filter → Quick access

Why: Faster repeat requests
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Request Not Found

**Problem:**
```
User: "I can't find my request AR-2024-01234"
```

**Solutions:**
```
1. Check search filters:
   My Requests → Clear all filters → Search again

2. Check date range:
   Expand to "All Time" instead of "Last 30 days"

3. Verify request ID:
   Confirm correct ID from email confirmation

4. Check if canceled:
   Status filter → Include "Canceled"

5. Admin lookup:
   Contact admin with request ID for investigation
```

#### Issue 2: Request Stuck in Pending

**Problem:**
```
Request pending approval for 5+ days
```

**Solutions:**
```
1. Check approver identity:
   View Details → Who is current approver?

2. Verify approver active:
   Admin → Identities → [Approver] → Status?

3. Check approval SLA:
   Is 5 days within normal range for this item?

4. Add comment:
   "Need this access urgently for client demo"
   Sends notification to approver

5. Contact approver directly:
   Email or call to follow up

6. Request reassignment:
   If approver on leave, ask admin to reassign
```

#### Issue 3: Request Shows Completed But No Access

**Problem:**
```
Status: Completed
But: User can't access system
```

**Solutions:**
```
1. Check provisioning details:
   View Details → Provisioning tab
   Were all items successful?

2. Verify system login:
   Try accessing target system
   Clear browser cache
   Re-authenticate

3. Check for replication delay:
   AD changes can take 15-30 minutes
   Wait and retry

4. Confirm correct account:
   Multiple accounts? Right one updated?

5. Contact support:
   If still no access after 1 hour
   Provide request ID for investigation
```
