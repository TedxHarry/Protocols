# 6.1.2 Capabilities Granted by Each Level

**Learning Objective:** Understand the specific capabilities and permissions granted to each user access level in SailPoint ISC.

---

## Understanding Capabilities

**Definition:** Capabilities are the specific actions and features a user can access based on their assigned access level

**Key Concept:**
```
Access Level → Capabilities

Example:
  Admin Access Level
    ↓
  Capabilities:
    - Configure sources
    - Manage users
    - Create workflows
    - View all identities
    - Everything in ISC
```

**Exam Tip:** Capabilities define WHAT users can do. Access levels grant different sets of capabilities.

```
Capability Needed:
  ✓ Search for user
  ✓ View account status
  ✓ Unlock account

Who Can Do This:
  ✓ Admin (has all capabilities)
  ✓ Helpdesk (if unlock capability enabled)
  ✗ Cert Admin (no unlock capability)
  ✗ Report Admin (no unlock capability)
  ✗ User (cannot unlock others)

Minimum Required: Helpdesk

  Don't need Admin access
  Helpdesk has this specific capability
  
Note: Unlock capability must be enabled for Helpdesk
```

**How to Perform:**
```
Login as: Helpdesk
Navigate: Admin → Identities → Search

Process:
  1. User calls: "I'm locked out of AD"
  
  2. Search for user:
     Enter: john.smith
     Find: John Smith (EMP12345)
  
  3. View accounts:
     Active Directory: john.smith
     Status: Locked 🔒
  
  4. Unlock account:
     Click "Unlock" button
     Confirm: "Unlock AD account?"
     Click "Yes"
  
  5. Verify:

  6. Inform user:
     "Your account is unlocked, please try logging in"

Access Level Used: Helpdesk capabilities
```

---

**Scenario 3: Create Custom Compliance Report Showing All Privileged Access**

**Required Access Level: Report Admin**

**Why:**
```
Capability Needed:
  ✓ Create custom reports
  ✓ Query all identities
  ✓ Filter by privileged access
  ✓ Export to Excel/PDF
  ✓ Schedule report

Who Can Do This:
  ✓ Admin (has all capabilities)
  ✓ Cert Admin (can create reports)
  ✓ Report Admin (reporting specialist)
  ✗ Helpdesk (no custom report creation)
  ✗ User (no reporting access)

Minimum Required: Report Admin

Why Not Lower:
  Helpdesk cannot create custom reports
  User cannot create reports
  
Why Report Admin (not Cert Admin):
  While Cert Admin can create reports, Report Admin is the 
  specialized role for reporting
  Best practice: Use Report Admin for reporting tasks
  Cert Admin should focus on certifications
  
Acceptable: Cert Admin could also do this, but Report Admin is better fit
```

**How to Perform:**
```
Login as: Report Admin
Navigate: Admin → Reports → Create Report

Report Configuration:
  Name: "Privileged Access Report"
  Description: "All users with admin/privileged access"
  
Query:
  Select: Identities
  Where:

  Include Columns:
    - Identity name
    - Employee ID
    - Department
    - Privileged access granted
    - Date granted
    - Approver

Access Level Used: Report Admin capabilities
```

---

**Scenario 4: Configure a New Salesforce Source in ISC**

**Required Access Level: Admin**

**Why:**
```
Capability Needed:
  ✓ Add new source
  ✓ Configure source connection
  ✓ Setup aggregation
  ✓ Configure provisioning
  ✓ Test connection
  ✓ Deploy to production

Who Can Do This:
  ✓ Admin (only)
  ✗ Cert Admin (no source configuration)
  ✗ Helpdesk (no source configuration)
  ✗ Report Admin (no source configuration)
  ✗ User (no source configuration)

Minimum Required: Admin

Why ONLY Admin:
  Source configuration is system-level
  Only Admin can add/configure sources
  No other access level has this capability
  
This is Admin-exclusive:
  Cannot be done by anyone else
  Must have Admin access level
```

**How to Perform:**
```
Login as: Admin
Navigate: Admin → Connections → Sources → Add Source

Configuration:
  1. Select source type:
     Choose: Salesforce
     
  2. Basic settings:
     Name: Salesforce Production
     Description: Primary Salesforce instance
     
  3. Connection:
     Type: Direct API
     Authentication: OAuth 2.0
     Instance URL: https://company.salesforce.com
     
  4. OAuth configuration:
     Create Connected App in Salesforce
     Client ID: [from Salesforce]
     Client Secret: [from Salesforce]
     
  5. Test connection:
     Click "Test Connection"
     Result: ✓ Connection successful
     
  6. Configure aggregation:
     Schedule: Daily at 2 AM
     Objects: Users, Profiles, Permission Sets
     
  7. Configure provisioning:
     Enable: Create, Update, Disable operations
     Disable: Delete (keep historical data)
     
  8. Attribute mapping:
     ISC.email → SF.Email
     ISC.firstName → SF.FirstName
     ISC.lastName → SF.LastName
     
  9. Save and deploy:
     ✓ Source created
     ✓ Ready for aggregation
     ✓ Provisioning enabled

Access Level Used: Admin capabilities (exclusive)
```

**Scenario 5: Request VPN Access for Yourself**

**Required Access Level: User**

**Why:**
```
Capability Needed:
  ✓ Log into ISC
  ✓ Browse access catalog
  ✓ Submit access request for self

Who Can Do This:
  ✓ Admin (has all capabilities)
  ✓ Cert Admin (can request for self)
  ✓ Helpdesk (can request for self)
  ✓ Report Admin (can request for self)
  ✓ User (self-service)

Minimum Required: User

Why User Level Works:
  Self-service access request capability
  All access levels include User capabilities
  Don't need higher access just to request for self
  
This is the baseline:
  Everyone can request access for themselves
  Even basic User level has this capability
```

**How to Perform:**
```
Login as: User (or any access level)
Navigate: Request Access

Process:
  1. Click "Request Access"
  
  2. Browse access catalog:

     Provisioning: Automatic
     
  4. Submit request:
     Access: VPN Access
     Justification: "Need remote access for work from home"
     Click "Submit"

**Summary Table:**

| Scenario | Minimum Access Level | Why |
|----------|---------------------|-----|
| **Launch certification campaign** | **Cert Admin** | Only Cert Admin+ can create campaigns |
| **Unlock user account** | **Helpdesk** | Only Helpdesk+ can unlock accounts |
| **Create compliance report** | **Report Admin** | Specialized reporting role |
| **Configure Salesforce source** | **Admin** | ONLY Admin can configure sources |
| **Request VPN for self** | **User** | Everyone can request for themselves |

---

**Key Learning Points:**
```
1. Source Configuration = Admin ONLY
   - No other level can configure sources
   - Admin-exclusive capability
   
2. Certifications = Cert Admin (minimum)
   - Cert Admin created for this purpose
   - Don't need full Admin
   
3. Account Unlock = Helpdesk (minimum)
   - Support function
   - Don't need Admin or Cert Admin
   
4. Custom Reports = Report Admin (best) or Cert Admin (acceptable)
   - Report Admin is specialist
   - Cert Admin can also create reports
   
5. Self-Service = User (everyone)
   - Baseline capability
   - All access levels can do this
```

**Exam Tip:** Know which capabilities are Admin-only (source config, system settings), which are specialized (Cert Admin for certifications, Helpdesk for unlock), and which are universal (self-service requests). Always use minimum required access level.
