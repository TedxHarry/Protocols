# 6.1.3 Assigning and Managing User Levels

**Learning Objective:** Learn how to assign, modify, and manage user access levels in SailPoint ISC.

---

## Understanding User Level Assignment

**Definition:** The process of granting ISC platform access to users and determining what they can do within ISC

**Key Concept:**
```
User Access Level Assignment:
  
  Step 1: User exists as identity in ISC
  Step 2: Grant ISC login access
  Step 3: Assign access level (Admin, Cert Admin, etc.)
  Step 4: User can log into ISC with assigned capabilities
```

**Important Distinction:**
```
Identity vs. ISC User:

Identity:
  - Person in ISC system
  - Has accounts in target systems (AD, Salesforce)
  - May or may not have ISC access
  - Example: 10,000 identities
  
ISC User:
  - Identity with ISC platform access
  - Can log into ISC
  - Has assigned access level
  - Example: 50 ISC users (out of 10,000 identities)
  
Not everyone needs ISC access!
  - Most employees don't need to log into ISC
  - Only IAM team, compliance, helpdesk need ISC access
```

**Exam Tip:** Identity exists in ISC ≠ Can log into ISC. Must explicitly grant ISC access and assign access level.

---

## Prerequisites for Assigning Access Levels

### **What You Need Before Assigning**

**Prerequisite 1: Identity Must Exist**
```
User must be in ISC as an identity first

How identities get into ISC:
  ✓ Aggregated from authoritative source (Workday, AD, HR system)
  ✓ Manually created (rare, for special cases)
  
Example:
  John Smith exists in Workday
  ISC aggregates from Workday
  John Smith now exists as identity in ISC
  Identity ID: 2c91808a7a3c4f9e017a3c5b8f2e0123
```

**Prerequisite 2: Email Address Required**
```
Identity must have email address

Why:
  - ISC sends login invitation to email
  - Email used for notifications
  - Email used for password reset
  
If missing email:
  - Cannot grant ISC access
  - Must populate email first
  
Check:
  Admin → Identities → Search: John Smith
  Verify: email = john.smith@company.com ✓
```

**Prerequisite 3: Admin Access Level Required**
```
Only Admins can assign access levels

Who can grant ISC access:
  ✓ Admin access level
  ✗ Cert Admin (cannot grant access)
  ✗ Helpdesk (cannot grant access)
  ✗ Report Admin (cannot grant access)
  ✗ User (cannot grant access)
  
Must be Admin to manage user access levels
```

---

## How to Assign Access Levels

### **Method 1: Grant Access via ISC UI (Primary Method)**

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Navigate to User Access Management**
```
Login as: Admin
Navigate: Admin → Admin → User Access

Alternative path:

  Example: "john.smith" or "john.smith@company.com"
  
Search results:
  Name: John Smith
  Email: john.smith@company.com
  Employee ID: EMP12345
  Current ISC Access: None (or current access level)
```

**Step 3: Grant Access**
```
If user has NO ISC access:
  Click "Add User" or "Grant Access"
  
If user already has ISC access:
  Click on username to modify
```

**Step 4: Select Access Level**
```
Access Level dropdown:
  ○ Admin
  ○ Cert Admin
  ○ Helpdesk
  ○ Report Admin
  ○ User
  
Select appropriate level:

```

**Step 5: Configure Additional Settings (Optional)**
```
Additional options (if available):
  
  ☐ Send welcome email
    - Notifies user of ISC access
    - Includes login instructions
    - Recommended: ✓ Checked
  
  Source Owner (if applicable):
    - Assign ownership of specific sources
    - Example: Make user owner of Salesforce source
    - Optional
  
  Organization Assignment (if using ORG structure):
    - Assign to specific organizations
    - Limits scope to certain departments/regions
    - Optional
```

**Step 6: Save and Send Invitation**
```
Click "Save" or "Grant Access"

System actions:
  1. Creates ISC user account
  2. Assigns access level
  3. Sends invitation email (if checked)
  
Result:
  ✓ User granted ISC access
  ✓ Access level: Helpdesk
  ✓ Invitation sent to: john.smith@company.com
```

**Step 7: User Receives Invitation**
```
Email received:
  Subject: "You've been invited to SailPoint IdentityNow"
  
  Content:
    "You have been granted access to SailPoint IdentityNow
     Access Level: Helpdesk
     
     Click here to set your password and log in:
     [Set Password Link]
     
     Link expires in: 7 days"
```

**Step 8: User Activates Access**
```
User clicks link in email:
  1. Redirected to password creation page
  2. Creates password (meets requirements)
  3. Password set successfully
  4. Redirected to ISC login
  5. Logs in with email and password
  6. Sees ISC interface with Helpdesk capabilities
```

## Modifying Existing Access Levels

### **Changing User Access Level**

**Scenario: Promote Helpdesk to Admin**

**Step 1: Navigate to User Access**
```
Login as: Admin
Navigate: Admin → Admin → User Access
```

**Step 2: Find User**
```
Search: sarah.williams@company.com

Current status:
  Name: Sarah Williams
  Email: sarah.williams@company.com
  Access Level: Helpdesk
  Status: Active
```

**Step 3: Modify Access**
```
Click on: Sarah Williams

Access Level Details:
  Current: Helpdesk
  
Change access level:
  Dropdown: Select "Admin"
  
Reason (if tracked):
  "Promoted to IAM Team Lead"
```

**Step 4: Save Changes**
```
Click "Save"

Confirmation:
  "Access level updated successfully"
  "Sarah Williams: Helpdesk → Admin"
  
Notification (optional):
  Email sent to user about access level change
```

**Step 5: Verify Change**
```
User's next login:
  Sarah logs in
  Now sees Admin capabilities:
    - Can configure sources
    - Can manage users
    - Can access all features
    
Previous Helpdesk restrictions removed
Now has full Admin access
```

---

### **Downgrading Access Level**

**Scenario: Change Admin to Cert Admin (Separation of Duties)**

**Process:**
```
1. Navigate: Admin → Admin → User Access

2. Find user:
   Current: Mike Thompson - Admin
   
3. Modify access:
   Change: Admin → Cert Admin
   Reason: "Moved to Compliance team, focus on certifications"
   
4. Save changes

5. Result:
   Mike Thompson now has Cert Admin access
   
   Can still:
     ✓ Create certification campaigns
     ✓ Generate certification reports
     ✓ View all identities
     
   Can no longer:
     ✗ Configure sources
     ✗ Setup provisioning
     ✗ Manage system settings
     ✗ Grant access to other users
     
   Better separation of duties ✓
```

## Revoking ISC Access

### **Removing ISC Access from User**

**When to Revoke:**
```
✓ Employee terminates (leaver)
✓ Role change (no longer needs ISC access)
✓ Security incident (suspend access)
✓ Temporary access expired
✓ Admin reassignment (reduce admin count)
```

**Step 1: Navigate to User Access**
```
Login as: Admin
Navigate: Admin → Admin → User Access
```

**Step 2: Find User**
```
Search: john.smith@company.com

Current status:
  Name: John Smith
  Access Level: Helpdesk
  Status: Active
```

**Step 3: Revoke Access**
```
Click on: John Smith

Options:
  - Modify access level
  - Revoke access
  
Click: "Revoke Access" or "Remove User"

Confirmation prompt:
  "Are you sure you want to revoke ISC access for John Smith?"
  
  Warning:
    - User will no longer be able to log into ISC
    - All pending approvals will be reassigned
    - User will be notified (if configured)
    
Confirm: "Yes, Revoke Access"
```

**Step 4: Handle Reassignments (If Applicable)**
```
If user has pending tasks:

Pending Approvals:
  - Reassign to: Sarah Williams (new manager)
  
Active Certifications:
  - Reassign to: Mike Thompson (compliance team)
  
Scheduled Reports:
  - Reassign to: David Martinez (report admin)
  - Or disable reports
```

**Step 5: Verify Revocation**
```
User attempts to log in:
  Email: john.smith@company.com
  Password: [password]
  
Result:
  Error: "Access denied. You do not have permission to access this system."
  
Or:
  Account disabled
  Cannot authenticate
  
ISC Access: Revoked ✓
```

**Important Notes:**
```
Revoking ISC access:
  ✓ Removes ISC platform access
  ✓ User cannot log into ISC
  
Does NOT affect:
  ✗ Identity in ISC (still exists)
  ✗ Accounts in target systems (AD, Salesforce still active)
  ✗ Access in other systems
  
To remove all access:
  1. Revoke ISC access (platform)
  2. Trigger leaver workflow (de-provision from targets)
```

---

## Bulk User Management

### **Granting Access to Multiple Users**

**Scenario: Onboard 10 new helpdesk team members**

**Method 1: Manual (One by one)**
```
Repeat for each user:
  1. Admin → Admin → User Access
  2. Add User
  3. Select identity
  4. Assign: Helpdesk
  5. Save
  
Time: 2-3 minutes per user
Total: 20-30 minutes for 10 users
```

**Method 2: CSV Import (If Available)**
```
Some ISC versions support bulk import:

1. Prepare CSV file:
   email,access_level,send_invitation
   user1@company.com,Helpdesk,true
   user2@company.com,Helpdesk,true
   user3@company.com,Helpdesk,true
   ...
   
2. Navigate: Admin → Admin → User Access
   
3. Click "Import Users" (if available)
   
4. Upload CSV file
   
5. Review and confirm:
   10 users will be granted Helpdesk access
   Invitations will be sent
   
6. Click "Import"
   
7. Results:
   ✓ 10 users granted access
   ✓ 10 invitations sent
   ✓ Total time: 5 minutes

Note: CSV import availability varies by ISC version
Check documentation for your version
```

**Method 3: API-Based (Advanced)**
```
For large-scale user management:

Use ISC API to grant access programmatically

Example (conceptual):
  POST /v3/users
  {
    "email": "user@company.com",
    "accessLevel": "HELPDESK",
    "sendInvitation": true
  }
  
Useful for:
  - Automated onboarding
  - Integration with HR systems
  - Large-scale user provisioning
  
Requires:
  - API knowledge
  - API credentials
  - Script development
```

## Managing Source Owners

### **Assigning Source Ownership**

**What is Source Owner:**
```
Source Owner:
  - User responsible for specific source
  - Can configure THAT source only
  - Cannot configure other sources
  - More limited than full Admin

Example:
  HR Team → Owns Workday source
  IT Team → Owns Active Directory source
  Sales Ops → Owns Salesforce source
```

**How to Assign Source Owner:**

**Step 1: Navigate to Source**
```
Admin → Connections → Sources
Select source: Salesforce Production
```

**Step 2: Configure Source Owner**
```
Source Settings → Owners

Add Owner:
  Search user: sales.admin@company.com
  Name: Sales Admin Team
  
Grant permissions:
  ☑ Configure source settings
  ☑ Modify aggregation schedule
  ☑ View source logs
  ☐ Delete source (usually restricted)
```

**Step 3: Save**
```
Click "Save"

Result:
  sales.admin@company.com is now Source Owner for Salesforce
  
Can now:
  ✓ Configure Salesforce source settings
  ✓ Modify aggregation schedule
  ✓ Test connection
  ✓ View source-specific data
  
Cannot:
  ✗ Configure other sources (AD, Workday)
  ✗ Manage users globally
  ✗ Access system settings
  ✗ Configure provisioning policies
```

**Source Owner Login:**
```
User logs in: sales.admin@company.com

Sees:
  - Connections → Sources → Salesforce Production ✓
  - Can modify Salesforce settings ✓
  
Does NOT see:
  - Other sources (grayed out or hidden)
  - System-level settings
  - User management
  
Limited to owned source only
```

## Access Level Best Practices

### **Security and Governance**

**Principle of Least Privilege:**
```
✓ Grant minimum access needed
✓ Default to User level for most
✓ Helpdesk only for support staff
✓ Admin only for IAM team (2-5 people)

Example Distribution (10,000 employees):
  Admin: 3 people (0.03%)
  Cert Admin: 5 people (0.05%)
  Helpdesk: 20 people (0.2%)
  Report Admin: 5 people (0.05%)
  User: 0 people (most don't need ISC access)
  No ISC Access: 9,967 people (99.67%)
  
Only 33 people need ISC access!
```

**Separation of Duties:**
```
✓ Separate Admin and Cert Admin roles
✓ Compliance team = Cert Admin (not Admin)
✓ IAM team = Admin (not Cert Admin)

Why:
  - Prevent conflict of interest
  - Compliance team certifies access
  - IAM team configures system
  - Should be different people
  
Example:
  IAM Team (Admin):
    - Sarah Johnson (IAM Lead)
    - Mike Chen (IAM Engineer)
    
  Compliance Team (Cert Admin):
    - Lisa Anderson (Compliance Manager)
    - Tom Wilson (Internal Audit)
    
  No overlap = Good separation
```

**Regular Access Reviews:**
```
✓ Review ISC access quarterly
✓ Verify users still need access
✓ Remove unnecessary access
✓ Validate access levels appropriate

Quarterly Review Process:
  1. Export all ISC users
  2. Review each user:
     - Still in role requiring ISC access?
     - Access level still appropriate?
     - Still employed?
     
  3. Actions:
     - Revoke: Terminated employees
     - Revoke: Role changed (no longer needs ISC)
     - Modify: Access level change needed
     - Maintain: Access still appropriate
     
  4. Document review
  5. Report to management
```

**Documentation:**
```
✓ Document why each user has ISC access
✓ Document access level rationale
✓ Track access changes

Example Documentation:
  User: sarah.williams@company.com
  Access Level: Helpdesk
  Granted: 2024-01-15
  Granted By: admin@company.com
  Reason: IT Support role, unlock accounts
  Business Justification: Support team member
  Last Reviewed: 2024-02-01
  Status: Active

## Troubleshooting Access Level Issues

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

**Issue 1: User Cannot Log Into ISC**

**Symptoms:**
```
User tries to log in:
  Email: john.smith@company.com
  Password: [password]
  
Result:
  Error: "Invalid credentials" or "Access denied"
```

**Diagnosis:**
```
Check 1: Does identity exist?
  Admin → Identities → Search: john.smith
  
  If NOT found:
    - Identity doesn't exist in ISC
    - Need to aggregate from source first
    
  If found:
    - Identity exists ✓
    - Continue to Check 2

Check 2: Has ISC access been granted?
  Admin → Admin → User Access
  Search: john.smith@company.com
  
  If NOT in list:
    - No ISC access granted
    - User is identity but not ISC user
    - Solution: Grant ISC access
    
  If in list:
    - ISC access exists ✓
    - Continue to Check 3

Check 3: Is access active?
  View user: john.smith@company.com
  Status: Active or Inactive?
  
  If Inactive:
    - Access was revoked or suspended
    - Solution: Reactivate access
    
  If Active:
    - Access should work ✓
    - Continue to Check 4

Check 4: Has user activated account?
  Check: Invitation status
  
  If "Invitation Pending":
    - User hasn't clicked invitation link
    - User hasn't set password
    - Solution: Resend invitation
    
  If "Active":
    - Account activated ✓
    - Password should work
    - May be password issue
```

**Solution:**
```
Most common: ISC access not granted

Fix:
  1. Admin → Admin → User Access
  2. Add User: john.smith@company.com
  3. Assign access level: Helpdesk
  4. ☑ Send welcome email
  5. Save
  
  User receives invitation
  Sets password
  Can now log in ✓
```

---

**Issue 2: User Has Wrong Capabilities**

**Symptoms:**
```
User complaint: "I can't configure sources"
User: sarah.williams@company.com
Current access level: Helpdesk
Expected: Should be able to configure sources
```

**Diagnosis:**
```
Check access level:
  Admin → Admin → User Access
  Search: sarah.williams@company.com
  
Current: Helpdesk

Capabilities:
  Helpdesk can:
    ✓ Search identities
    ✓ Unlock accounts
    ✗ Configure sources ← Missing capability
    
To configure sources:
  Need: Admin access level
```

**Solution:**
```
Upgrade access level:
  1. Admin → Admin → User Access
  2. Find: sarah.williams@company.com
  3. Modify access level: Helpdesk → Admin
  4. Save
  
Sarah now has Admin access
Can configure sources ✓
```

---

**Issue 3: Too Many Admins (Security Risk)**

**Symptoms:**
```
Security audit finds: 15 people with Admin access
Recommended: 3-5 Admins maximum
Risk: Too many people can configure system
```

**Diagnosis:**
```
Review Admin list:
  Admin → Admin → User Access
  Filter: Access Level = Admin
  
Results: 15 Admins
  
Review each:
  - Who are they?
  - Why do they have Admin?
  - Do they still need it?
```

**Solution:**
```
Rightsize Admin access:

Review and categorize:
  
  Keep as Admin (3):
    - IAM Team Lead (needs full access)
    - Senior IAM Engineer (needs full access)
    - IAM Manager (needs full access)
    
  Change to Cert Admin (4):
    - Compliance Manager (only needs certifications)
    - Internal Auditor (only needs certifications)
    - Compliance Analyst (only needs certifications)
    - Risk Manager (only needs certifications)
    
  Change to Report Admin (3):
    - BI Analyst (only needs reporting)
    - Data Analyst (only needs reporting)
    - Compliance Reporting (only needs reporting)
    
  Change to Helpdesk (3):
    - IT Support Lead (only needs user support)
    - Service Desk Manager (only needs user support)
    - Support Engineer (only needs user support)
    
  Revoke Access (2):
    - Former employee (terminated)
    - Transferred employee (no longer in IAM)

Result:
  Admins reduced: 15 → 3
  Better security ✓
  Separation of duties ✓
```

    Password: [her password]
    
  Result:
    Error: "Access denied. You do not have permission to access this system."
    
  Or:
    "Your account has been deactivated. Contact your administrator."
    
  ISC access revoked ✓

Step 9: Important Notes
  What was revoked:
    ✗ ISC platform access (cannot log into ISC)
    
  What was NOT affected:
    ✓ Identity still exists in ISC
    ✓ Accounts in target systems still active
      - AD account: jennifer.brooks (still active)
      - Email: jennifer.brooks@company.com (still active)
      - Salesforce (still active if she had it)
      
  Jennifer still an employee:
    - Just transferred departments
    - Doesn't need ISC access
    - But still needs her regular accounts

Step 10: Update Documentation
  Document revocation:
    User: jennifer.brooks@company.com
    Action: ISC access revoked
    Date: 2024-02-14
    Revoked By: admin@company.com
    Reason: Transferred to Business Analyst role

      - tom.chen@company.com (IAM Engineer)
      
    Removed:
      - jennifer.brooks@company.com ← No longer Admin

Step 11: Security Review
  Review Admin count:
    Total Admins: 3 (down from 4)
    Appropriate reduction ✓
    
  Principle of least privilege:
    Jennifer doesn't need ISC access in new role ✓
    Access revoked appropriately ✓
```

**Result:**
```
✓ Jennifer Brooks ISC access revoked
✓ Can no longer log into ISC platform
✓ Pending tasks reassigned to other admins
✓ Identity and accounts in target systems unaffected
✓ Admin count reduced (better security)

## Section Summary

**Core Concepts for Certification:**

✅ **Prerequisites for Assigning Access:**
- Identity must exist in ISC first
- Identity must have email address
- Only Admin can assign access levels
- User receives invitation email to activate

✅ **Granting Access Process:**
1. Verify identity exists
2. Admin → Admin → User Access
3. Add User / Grant Access
4. Select identity and assign access level
5. Send invitation email
6. User sets password and activates
7. User can log in with assigned capabilities

✅ **Modifying Access:**
- Find user in User Access management
- Change access level (upgrade or downgrade)
- Save changes (takes effect immediately)
- User has new capabilities on next login
- Document changes for audit

✅ **Revoking Access:**
- Check for pending tasks (approvals, certifications, reports)
- Reassign pending tasks to other users
- Revoke ISC access
- User cannot log into ISC
- Identity and target system accounts unaffected

✅ **Best Practices:**
- Principle of least privilege (minimum access needed)
- Most users don't need ISC access
- Separate Admin and Cert Admin (separation of duties)
- Regular access reviews (quarterly)
- Document all access changes
- Limit Admin access to 2-5 people

✅ **Common Issues:**
- User can't log in → ISC access not granted (grant access)
- Wrong capabilities → Wrong access level (modify level)
- Too many Admins → Security risk (rightsize access)

**Exam Focus Areas:**
- Know identity must exist before granting ISC access
- Understand grant process (Admin → User Access → Assign level)
- Remember only Admin can assign access levels
- Know how to modify existing access levels
- Understand revoke process (check pending tasks first)
- Remember principle of least privilege
- Know to separate Admin and Cert Admin roles

**Study Tips:**
- **Grant access**: Verify identity exists → User Access → Assign level → Send invitation
- **Modify access**: Find user → Change level → Save
- **Revoke access**: Check pending tasks → Reassign → Revoke
- **Least privilege**: Minimum access needed
- **Most users**: Don't need ISC access
- **Admin**: Only IAM team (2-5 people)
