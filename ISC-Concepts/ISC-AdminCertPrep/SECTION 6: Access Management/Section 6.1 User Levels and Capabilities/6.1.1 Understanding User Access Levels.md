# 6.1.1 Understanding User Access Levels

**Learning Objective:** Understand the different user access levels in SailPoint ISC and what they control.

---

## What are User Access Levels?

**Definition:** User access levels determine what a user can do within the SailPoint ISC platform itself (not in target systems)

**Key Concept:**
```
User Access Levels control ISC platform access:
  - What ISC features user can access
  - What ISC actions user can perform
  - What ISC data user can view
  
They do NOT control:
  - Access to Active Directory
  - Access to Salesforce
  - Access to other target systems
  
Target system access = Managed separately through provisioning
```

**Simple Example:**
```
Alice (ISC Admin):
  ISC Access Level: Admin
  Can: Configure sources, view all identities, run reports
  
Bob (End User):
  ISC Access Level: User
  Can: Request access, view own profile
  Cannot: Configure sources, view other identities
```

**Exam Tip:** User access levels control what users can do IN SailPoint ISC, not what they can do in target systems like AD or Salesforce.

## Access Level Assignment Strategy

### **Best Practices**

**Principle of Least Privilege:**
```
✓ Grant minimum access needed
✓ Most users should be "User" level
✓ Helpdesk only for support staff
✓ Admin only for IAM team
✓ Review access levels regularly
```

**Typical Distribution:**
```
Large Organization (10,000 employees):
  
  Admin: 3-5 people (0.05%)
    - IAM team leads
    - SailPoint administrators
    
  Cert Admin: 5-10 people (0.1%)
    - Compliance team
    - Internal audit
    
  Helpdesk: 20-50 people (0.5%)
    - IT service desk
    - User support team
    
  Report Admin: 5-10 people (0.1%)
    - BI team
    - Compliance reporting
    
  User: 9,900+ people (99%)
    - All employees
    - Self-service only
```

**Separation of Duties:**
```
✓ Admin and Cert Admin should be separate
  Reason: Prevent conflict of interest
  
✓ Helpdesk should not be Admin
  Reason: Limit access to configuration
  
✓ Regular access level reviews
  Frequency: Quarterly or semi-annually
```

  - Jenny doesn't need Admin access
  
✓ Separation of Duties
  - Admin (Sarah) separate from Cert Admin (Mike)
  - Prevents conflict of interest
  
✓ Role-Based Assignment
  - Access level matches job function
  - IAM team = Admin
  - Compliance = Cert Admin
  - Support = Helpdesk
  - Analyst = Report Admin
  - Employee = User
  
✓ Clear Justification
  - Each assignment has business reason
  - Documented responsibilities
  - Aligns with job duties
```

**Exam Tip:** Match access level to job function: Admin for IAM team, Cert Admin for compliance, Helpdesk for support, Report Admin for analysts, User for employees. Use principle of least privilege.
