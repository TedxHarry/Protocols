# Section 6.5: Access Management Troubleshooting

## 6.5.1: Common Access Management Errors

### Overview
Access management errors in SailPoint ISC fall into several categories: aggregation failures, correlation issues, provisioning errors, role assignment problems, and access request failures. Understanding common error patterns, their root causes, and systematic troubleshooting approaches is essential for effective ISC administration.

**What you'll learn:**
- Common error categories and symptoms
- Root cause identification techniques
- Systematic troubleshooting methodology
- Prevention strategies
- Escalation criteria

---

### Error Categories

#### Category 1: Aggregation Errors

**Definition:** Failures during the process of reading account and entitlement data from source systems into ISC.

**Common symptoms:**
- Source aggregation task fails
- Incomplete account data
- Missing entitlements
- "Connection timeout" errors
- "Authentication failed" messages
- Zero accounts aggregated when expecting thousands

---

### Category 2: Correlation Errors

**Definition:** Failures when ISC attempts to link accounts from various sources to a single identity.

**Common symptoms:**
- Accounts remain uncorrelated
- Multiple identities created for same person
- "Mark Invalid" error
- Accounts associated with wrong identity
- Identity cube refresh failures

---

### Category 3: Provisioning Errors

**Definition:** Failures when ISC attempts to create, modify, or delete accounts/entitlements on target systems.

**Common symptoms:**
- Access request approved but not provisioned
- "Provisioning failed" status
- Account creation errors
- Entitlement assignment failures
- Partial provisioning (some access granted, some failed)

---

### Category 4: Role Assignment Errors

**Definition:** Failures in automatic role assignment based on membership criteria.

**Common symptoms:**
- Role not assigning to expected identities
- Role assigning to wrong identities
- Mass unexpected revocations
- Role assignment delays
- Zero role members when expecting many

---

### Category 5: Access Request Errors

**Definition:** Failures in the access request workflow from submission to fulfillment.

**Common symptoms:**
- Request stuck in "Pending" status
- Approval workflow not triggering
- Request fails validation
- "Item not requestable" error
- Request completes but access not granted

---

## Detailed Error Analysis

### Aggregation Errors

#### Error 1.1: Connection Timeout

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Connection to source timed out after 30 seconds
Source: Active Directory (10.5.2.100)
Status: Failed
Accounts aggregated: 0
```

**Common causes:**

**1. Network connectivity issues**
- Firewall blocking ISC Virtual Appliance (VA) to source
- Network latency > 30 seconds
- Source system down or unreachable
- DNS resolution failure

**2. VA cluster problems**
- VA offline or disconnected
- VA overloaded with other tasks
- VA-to-cloud connection issues

**3. Source system performance**
- Source system under heavy load
- Source database locked
- Insufficient source system resources

**Troubleshooting steps:**

**Step 1: Verify network connectivity**
```bash
# From VA, test connectivity
ping <source_hostname>
telnet <source_hostname> <port>

# For Active Directory
telnet dc01.corp.local 389  # LDAP
telnet dc01.corp.local 636  # LDAPS
```

**Step 2: Check VA status**
```
Admin → Setup → Sources → [Source] → Check Status
Look for: "VA Cluster Status: Connected"
```

**Step 3: Review VA cluster health**
```
Admin → Setup → Virtual Appliance Clusters
Check:
- Status: Active
- Last check-in: < 5 minutes ago
- Queue size: Reasonable (<100)
```

**Step 4: Test source credentials**
```
Admin → Setup → Sources → [Source] → Test Connection
```

**Step 5: Check source logs**
- Review source system logs for connection attempts
- Look for authentication failures
- Check for resource constraints

**Solutions:**

**Network issue:**
- Open required firewall ports
- Fix DNS resolution
- Reduce network latency

**VA issue:**
- Restart VA cluster
- Upgrade VA if outdated
- Add additional VA for load balancing

**Source issue:**
- Increase timeout value (if configurable)
- Schedule aggregation during off-peak hours
- Optimize source queries
- Scale source system resources

---

#### Error 1.2: Authentication Failed

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Authentication failed for user 'sa_sailpoint'
Source: HR System (Oracle DB)
Status: Failed
Details: Invalid credentials or account locked
```

**Common causes:**

**1. Incorrect credentials**
- Password changed on source
- Username typo in configuration
- Wrong credentials entered

**2. Account status issues**
- Service account locked
- Service account expired
- Service account disabled

**3. Permission problems**
- Insufficient read permissions
- Missing required roles
- Delegation expired

**Troubleshooting steps:**

**Step 1: Verify credentials manually**
```bash
# Test with same credentials ISC uses
# For AD:
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://dc01.corp.local -D "CN=sa_sailpoint,OU=Service,DC=corp,DC=local" -W

# For SQL:
sqlplus sa_sailpoint@HRDB
```

**Step 2: Check account status**
```
On source system:
- Verify account not locked
- Check password expiration
- Confirm account enabled
```

**Step 3: Review permissions**
```
Verify service account has:
- Read access to required data
- Execute permissions for queries
- Access to required views/tables
```

**Solutions:**

**Password changed:**
```
Admin → Setup → Sources → [Source] → Edit
Update password in connection settings
Test connection
Run aggregation
```

**Account locked:**
```
Unlock account on source system
Wait 5-10 minutes for replication
Test connection
Run aggregation
```

**Permissions missing:**
```
Grant required permissions on source
Example (SQL):
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO sa_sailpoint;
GRANT SELECT ON departments TO sa_sailpoint;
```

---

#### Error 1.3: Incomplete Data Aggregation

**Symptoms:**
```
Aggregation Status: Success
Accounts aggregated: 15,234
Expected accounts: 25,000
Warning: ~40% of expected accounts missing
```

**Common causes:**

**1. Filter/query limitations**
- Source filter too restrictive
- Query missing population segments
- Container/OU not included

**2. Pagination issues**
- Page size too small
- Pagination not configured
- Timeout during large result sets

**3. Data quality problems**
- Missing required attributes
- Null values in correlation field
- Invalid data formats

**Troubleshooting steps:**

**Step 1: Review aggregation configuration**
```
Admin → Setup → Sources → [Source] → Account Aggregation
Check:
- Search base/container
- Filter query
- Attributes being read
```

**Step 2: Test query directly on source**
```bash
# AD example - test LDAP query
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://dc01 -D "..." -W \
  -b "DC=corp,DC=local" \
  "(&(objectClass=user)(!(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2)))" \
  | grep "dn:"  | wc -l
```

**Step 3: Check for errors in aggregation log**
```
Admin → Dashboard → Activity → Search
Filter: Source = [Source], Status = Failed or Warning
Review individual account errors
```

**Step 4: Validate source data**
```
Check source for:
- All expected OUs/containers
- Account distribution across locations
- Data completeness
```

**Solutions:**

**Filter too restrictive:**
```
# Before (AD):
(&(objectClass=user)(department=Sales))  ← Only Sales

# After (AD):
(objectClass=user)  ← All users
```

**Add missing containers:**
```
Search base DN: DC=corp,DC=local
Additional containers:
- OU=Contractors,DC=corp,DC=local
- OU=Vendors,DC=corp,DC=local
```

**Increase pagination:**
```
Page size: 100 → 1000
(Balance between performance and completeness)
```

### Correlation Errors

#### Error 2.1: Multiple Identities for Same Person

**Symptoms:**
```
Problem: User "John Smith" has 3 separate identities
- john.smith (from HR)
- jsmith (from AD)  
- j.smith (from email system)

Expected: 1 identity with 3 correlated accounts
Actual: 3 identities, each with 1 account
```

**Common causes:**

**1. Identity attribute mismatch**
- Correlation attribute values don't match exactly
- Case sensitivity differences
- Leading/trailing whitespace
- Format differences (email vs. username)

**2. Missing correlation configuration**
- Identity Profile not configured properly
- Correlation logic incomplete
- Account schema missing correlation field

**3. Timing issues**
- Non-authoritative source aggregated first
- Identity created before authoritative data arrives

**Troubleshooting steps:**

**Step 1: Check identity attribute values**
```
Admin → Identities → [Search for user]
For each identity, check correlation attribute:
- john.smith: employeeID = "12345"
- jsmith: employeeID = "12345 " (trailing space!)
- j.smith: employeeID = missing
```

**Step 2: Review Identity Profile configuration**
```
Admin → Identity Profiles → [Profile]
Check:
- Authoritative source setting
- Identity attribute mappings
- Correlation configuration
```

**Step 3: Examine account correlation values**
```
For each uncorrelated account:
Admin → Sources → [Source] → Accounts → [Account]
Check value of correlation attribute
Compare to identity's correlation attribute
```

**Step 4: Review aggregation order**
```
Check which source aggregated first:
Admin → Dashboard → Activity
Look for aggregation timestamps
```

**Solutions:**

**Fix attribute mismatch with transform:**
```json
{
  "type": "trim",
  "input": {
    "type": "accountAttribute",
    "attributes": {
      "sourceName": "Active Directory",
      "attributeName": "employeeID"
    }
  }
}
```

**Add correlation to Identity Profile:**
```
Admin → Identity Profiles → [Profile] → Mappings
Identity Attribute: uid
Transform: Use employeeID from authoritative source
Correlation: Enabled
```

**Manual correlation (short-term fix):**
```
Admin → Identities → [Correct Identity]
→ Accounts tab → Add Account
Select uncorrelated account
Click "Correlate"
```

**Long-term fix - Merge identities:**
```
1. Identify correct "master" identity
2. Manually correlate all accounts to master
3. Delete duplicate identities
4. Fix root cause (correlation config)
5. Run identity refresh
```

---

#### Error 2.2: "Mark Invalid" Error

**Symptoms:**
```
Error during identity refresh:
"Mark Invalid Error: Ambiguous authoritative source for identity"
Task stopped: Refresh Identity Cubes
Identity: john.smith@corp.com
```

**Common causes:**

**1. Multiple authoritative sources for same identity**
- Two sources both marked as authoritative
- Both sources have accounts for same person
- System cannot determine which is "truth"

**2. Ambiguous manager correlation**
- Manager attribute points to ambiguous identity
- Manager exists in multiple sources with different values

**Troubleshooting steps:**

**Step 1: Identify identity and sources**
```
Admin → Identities → Search for identity with error
Check Accounts tab:
- How many accounts?
- Which sources?
- Which marked authoritative?
```

**Step 2: Review Identity Profile configuration**
```
Admin → Identity Profiles
Check each profile:
- Is authoritative source setting correct?
- Only ONE should be authoritative per identity
```

**Step 3: Check for duplicate authoritative accounts**
```
For problem identity:
Count accounts where isAuthoritative = true
If count > 1: Problem confirmed
```

**Solutions:**

**Remove duplicate authoritative designation:**
```
1. Determine which source should be authoritative
   (Usually HR system)

2. Update Identity Profiles:
   HR Profile: Authoritative = true
   AD Profile: Authoritative = false
   
3. Delete/refresh affected identities

4. Re-run aggregation and refresh
```

**Fix manager correlation:**
```
1. Identify ambiguous manager reference

2. Update manager attribute in source to use unique value
   (e.g., employeeID instead of name)

3. Update Identity Profile mapping for manager attribute

4. Re-aggregate and refresh
```

### Provisioning Errors

#### Error 3.1: Account Creation Failed

**Symptoms:**
```
Access Request ID: AR-2024-00512
Status: Failed
Error: Account creation failed on Active Directory
Details: "The specified account already exists"
User: jane.doe
Request: Create AD account
```

**Common causes:**

**1. Account already exists**
- Orphaned account from previous employment
- Account created manually outside ISC
- Naming collision

**2. Insufficient permissions**
- ISC service account lacks create permissions
- Target OU restrictions
- Account creation policy violations

**3. Required attributes missing**
- Mandatory AD attributes not provided
- Invalid attribute values
- Attribute length/format violations

**4. Provisioning policy errors**
- Before-create script failures
- Validation failures
- Naming convention issues

**Troubleshooting steps:**

**Step 1: Verify account doesn't exist**
```bash
# Check target system directly
# AD example:
Get-ADUser -Filter "sAMAccountName -eq 'jane.doe'"

# If exists:
Get-ADUser jane.doe -Properties * | Select-Object whenCreated, whenChanged
```

**Step 2: Check ISC service account permissions**
```
On target system:
1. Verify ISC account has delegated permissions
2. Check OU-level restrictions
3. Confirm create permissions granted
```

**Step 3: Review provisioning policy**
```
Admin → Setup → Sources → [Source] → Provisioning
Check:
- Create Account form
- Required fields
- Field mappings
- Before/after create scripts
```

**Step 4: Check provisioning logs**
```
Admin → Dashboard → Activity → Access Requests → [Request]
Click on provisioning task
Review detailed error messages
```

**Solutions:**

**Account exists - adopt it:**
```
1. Correlate existing account to identity
2. Update account attributes if needed
3. Complete access request manually
4. Close provisioning task
```

**Permissions missing:**
```
Grant ISC service account:
- Create user objects in target OU
- Write to all required attributes
- Read permissions for validation

# AD example - delegate permissions
dsacls "OU=Users,DC=corp,DC=local" /G "ISC-Service:CC;user"
```

**Missing required attributes:**
```
Update provisioning policy:
1. Map all required target attributes
2. Provide default values where appropriate
3. Add validation

Example (AD):
- sAMAccountName: ${firstName}.${lastName}
- userPrincipalName: ${sAMAccountName}@corp.local
- mail: ${sAMAccountName}@corp.com
```

---

#### Error 3.2: Entitlement Assignment Failed

**Symptoms:**
```
Access Request ID: AR-2024-00513  
Status: Partially Completed
Account creation: Success
Entitlement assignment: Failed

Granted:
✓ AD Account created

Failed:
✗ Security Group: "VPN-Users" 
   Error: "The specified group cannot be found"
```

**Common causes:**

**1. Entitlement no longer exists**
- Group deleted from source
- Entitlement aggregation outdated
- Stale entitlement cache

**2. Permissions insufficient**
- ISC account can't modify group membership
- Entitlement in protected OU
- Special group restrictions (e.g., Domain Admins)

**3. Account not fully created yet**
- Timing issue between account create and entitlement grant
- Replication delay
- Account not yet available

**4. Invalid entitlement reference**
- Entitlement ID incorrect
- Source changed
- Access Profile misconfigured

**Troubleshooting steps:**

**Step 1: Verify entitlement exists**
```bash
# AD example:
Get-ADGroup "VPN-Users"

# If not found:
# - When was it deleted?
# - Why wasn't ISC updated?
```

**Step 2: Check ISC entitlement data**
```
Admin → Setup → Sources → [Source] → Entitlements
Search for: VPN-Users
Check:
- Does it exist in ISC?
- When last aggregated?
- Native identity value correct?
```

**Step 3: Test permissions**
```bash
# Try to add user to group with ISC service account
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "VPN-Users" -Members "test.user"

# If fails - permission issue
# If succeeds - different problem
```

**Step 4: Check for replication delay**
```
# For AD environments with multiple DCs
# Check if account exists on all DCs
Get-ADUser "jane.doe" -Server DC01
Get-ADUser "jane.doe" -Server DC02

# Check replication status
repadmin /showrepl
```

**Solutions:**

**Stale entitlement - refresh:**
```
Admin → Setup → Sources → [Source]
→ Load Entitlements (or Aggregation)
Wait for completion
Retry provisioning
```

**Permission issue:**
```
Grant ISC service account:
- Write to group membership attribute
- Modify group objects

# AD delegation example:
dsacls "OU=Groups,DC=corp,DC=local" /G "ISC-Service:WP;member"
```

**Replication delay - add retry:**
```
Configure provisioning retry:
1. Wait 30 seconds after account creation
2. Retry entitlement assignment
3. Up to 3 retry attempts

Or manually:
1. Wait for replication (15-30 min)
2. Retry failed provisioning manually
```

**Entitlement deleted - update access profile:**
```
Admin → Access Profiles → [Profile]
→ Entitlements tab
Remove deleted entitlement
Add replacement entitlement (if needed)
Communicate change to users
```

### Role Assignment Errors

#### Error 4.1: Role Not Assigning

**Symptoms:**
```
Role: "Sales Representative"
Expected members: ~150 (based on HR data)
Actual members: 0
Status: Enabled
Criteria: department = "Sales"
```

**Common causes:**

**1. Criteria doesn't match data**
- Case sensitivity mismatch
- Whitespace differences
- Attribute values different than expected
- Null/missing attributes

**2. Role disabled**
- enabled = false
- Recently disabled by admin
- Never enabled after creation

**3. Identity refresh not run**
- Criteria added but identities not refreshed
- Scheduled refresh disabled
- Refresh failing silently

**4. Access profiles issue**
- No access profiles in role (if enabled=true, this causes error)
- Access profiles disabled
- Source issues preventing assignment

**Troubleshooting steps:**

**Step 1: Check role configuration**
```
Admin → Roles → [Role]
Verify:
✓ enabled = true
✓ At least 1 access profile present
✓ Criteria syntax valid
```

**Step 2: Check actual identity attribute values**
```
Admin → Identities → [Sample identity who should have role]
Check department attribute:
- Value: "sales" (lowercase - won't match!)
- Expected: "Sales"
```

**Step 3: Test criteria with search**
```
Admin → Identities → Search
Filter: department = "Sales"
Results: Should show ~150 identities
If 0 results: Criteria issue
```

**Step 4: Check identity refresh status**
```
Admin → Dashboard → Activity
Filter: Task = Identity Refresh
Check:
- Last run time
- Status
- Errors
```

**Solutions:**

**Case mismatch:**
```json
// Add transform to standardize case
{
  "name": "Department - Uppercase",
  "type": "upper",
  "input": {
    "type": "identityAttribute",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "department"
    }
  }
}

// Update criteria to match transformed value
{
  "type": "IDENTITY",
  "key": "department",
  "operation": "EQUALS",
  "value": "SALES"  // Now uppercase
}
```

**Role disabled:**
```
Admin → Roles → [Role] → Edit
enabled: true
Save
Wait for next identity refresh or trigger manual refresh
```

**Identity refresh not running:**
```
Option 1 - Manual refresh:
Admin → Identities → Select identity → Refresh

Option 2 - Bulk refresh:
Trigger source aggregation (refreshes all identities)

Option 3 - Fix scheduled refresh:
Admin → Setup → Identity Processing
Verify refresh scheduled and enabled
```

---

#### Error 4.2: Role Assigning to Wrong Identities

**Symptoms:**
```
Role: "Finance Analysts"
Criteria: department = "Finance" AND title CONTAINS "Analyst"
Expected members: 25 Finance Analysts
Actual members: 157 (including IT, Sales, HR analysts)
```

**Common causes:**

**1. Criteria too broad**
- CONTAINS matching unintended values
- Missing AND conditions
- OR when should be AND

**2. Data quality issues**
- Inconsistent title values in source
- Multiple ways to represent same thing
- Null handling

**3. Logic error in criteria**
- Incorrect operator (AND vs. OR)
- Wrong nesting
- Negation error

**Troubleshooting steps:**

**Step 1: Review unexpected members**
```
Admin → Roles → [Role] → Members tab
Export member list
Analyze unexpected inclusions:
- Common attributes?
- Pattern in departments/titles?
```

**Step 2: Check criteria logic**
```
Current:
{
  "operation": "OR",  ← Should be AND!
  "children": [
    {"type": "IDENTITY", "key": "department", "operation": "EQUALS", "value": "Finance"},
    {"type": "IDENTITY", "key": "title", "operation": "CONTAINS", "value": "Analyst"}
  ]
}

Matches:
- Finance (any title) ← Wrong
- Analyst (any department) ← Wrong
```

**Step 3: Test corrected criteria**
```
Admin → Identities → Search
Test: department = "Finance" AND title CONTAINS "Analyst"
Verify result count matches expectation
```

**Solutions:**

**Fix operator:**
```json
{
  "operation": "AND",  // Changed from OR
  "children": [
    {"type": "IDENTITY", "key": "department", "operation": "EQUALS", "value": "Finance"},
    {"type": "IDENTITY", "key": "title", "operation": "CONTAINS", "value": "Analyst"}
  ]
}
```

**Make criteria more specific:**
```json
{
  "operation": "AND",
  "children": [
    {"type": "IDENTITY", "key": "department", "operation": "EQUALS", "value": "Finance"},
    {
      "operation": "OR",
      "children": [
        {"type": "IDENTITY", "key": "title", "operation": "EQUALS", "value": "Financial Analyst"},
        {"type": "IDENTITY", "key": "title", "operation": "EQUALS", "value": "Sr. Financial Analyst"},
        {"type": "IDENTITY", "key": "title", "operation": "EQUALS", "value": "Junior Financial Analyst"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Address data quality:**
```
1. Standardize titles in source system (long-term)
2. Use transform to normalize values (medium-term)
3. Adjust criteria to work with current data (short-term)
```

### Access Request Errors

#### Error 5.1: Request Stuck in Pending

**Symptoms:**
```
Access Request ID: AR-2024-00515
Requested by: john.doe
Requested item: "Engineering Tools" access profile
Status: Pending Approval
Time in pending: 72 hours
Expected: Approval within 24 hours
```

**Common causes:**

**1. Approver unavailable**
- Approver on leave
- Approver account disabled
- Approver not checking emails

**2. Approval workflow misconfigured**
- No valid approver found
- Fallback approver not configured
- Workflow rule error

**3. Email notification failure**
- Email not delivered
- Spam filter blocking
- Wrong email address

**4. Work reassignment needed**
- Approver changed roles
- Manager changed
- Governance group disbanded

**Troubleshooting steps:**

**Step 1: Check approval workflow**
```
Admin → Access Request → [Request ID]
Check:
- Who is current approver?
- Status: Pending with whom?
- Workflow steps completed/remaining
```

**Step 2: Verify approver status**
```
Admin → Identities → [Approver]
Check:
- Account status: Active?
- Email address: Valid?
- Lifecycle state: Not leaver/terminated?
```

**Step 3: Check email delivery**
```
Review:
- Email logs for notification send
- Spam/junk folders
- Email server logs
- Approver email accessibility
```

**Step 4: Review approval configuration**
```
Admin → Access Profiles → [Requested Profile]
→ Access Request Configuration
Check:
- Approval chain defined
- Approvers valid
- Fallback configured
```

**Solutions:**

**Reassign work item:**
```
Admin → Access Requests → [Request]
→ Reassign Approval
Select new approver
Add comment explaining reassignment
Save
```

**Fix workflow configuration:**
```
Admin → Access Profiles → [Profile]
→ Access Request Configuration

Update:
- Primary approver: MANAGER (dynamic)
- Fallback: Access Profile Owner
- Escalation: After 48 hours → Owner
```

**Manually complete stuck request:**
```
Admin → Access Requests → [Request]
If approved elsewhere (email, verbal):
→ Manual Approval
Add justification
Complete provisioning
```

---

#### Error 5.2: "Item Not Requestable" Error

**Symptoms:**
```
User attempt to request: "VPN Access" role
Error: "This item is not available for request"
User can see role in search
Role shows in catalog
But request button grayed out
```

**Common causes:**

**1. Requestable flag = false**
- Role configured as auto-assign only
- Admin forgot to enable requestable
- Intentionally not requestable

**2. User already has it**
- Role already assigned via auto-assignment
- Direct entitlement already granted
- Access profile already assigned

**3. Criteria excludes requester**
- Role criteria doesn't match user
- AND requestable would create conflict
- Policy violation if granted

**4. Role disabled**
- enabled = false
- Recently disabled
- Maintenance mode

**Troubleshooting steps:**

**Step 1: Check role configuration**
```
Admin → Roles → [Role]
Check:
✓ enabled = true?
✓ requestable = true?
```

**Step 2: Check if user already has access**
```
Admin → Identities → [User] → Roles tab
Look for: Role already assigned?

→ Access tab
Look for: Entitlements from this role already present?
```

**Step 3: Test with different user**
```
Impersonate or check with user who should be able to request
If works: User-specific issue
If fails: Role-level issue
```

**Solutions:**

**Enable requestable:**
```
Admin → Roles → [Role] → Edit
requestable: true
Configure approval workflow
Save
```

**User already has it:**
```
Explain to user:
"You already have VPN Access via auto-assignment from your Remote Worker role. No request needed."

Or if via different path:
Show user their current access
No action needed
```

**Fix criteria conflict:**
```
If role auto-assigns but also requestable:
- Ensure criteria doesn't conflict
- Configure appropriate approvals for exception requests
- Document when requests allowed vs. auto-assigned
```

### Troubleshooting Methodology

#### Systematic Approach

**Step 1: Gather information**
- What is the exact error message?
- When did it start occurring?
- Is it affecting one user or many?
- What changed recently?
- Can the error be reproduced?

**Step 2: Identify error category**
- Aggregation?
- Correlation?
- Provisioning?
- Role assignment?
- Access request?

**Step 3: Check obvious causes first**
- Is system/source up and reachable?
- Are credentials valid?
- Was recent change made?
- Is feature enabled?

**Step 4: Review logs and activity**
- System logs
- Source aggregation logs
- Provisioning logs
- Access request history
- Audit logs

**Step 5: Isolate the problem**
- Test with single user
- Test with single source
- Test with single role
- Narrow scope until root cause found

**Step 6: Implement fix**
- Apply solution
- Test fix
- Monitor for recurrence
- Document resolution

**Step 7: Prevent recurrence**
- Fix root cause, not just symptom
- Update documentation
- Add monitoring/alerts
- Train team on prevention

---

**1. Proactive monitoring**
- Set up alerts for common errors
- Daily review of failed tasks
- Weekly metrics review
- Trend analysis

**2. Regular maintenance**
- Test credentials monthly
- Review and update correlation rules
- Clean up stale data
- Optimize queries

**3. Change management**
- Test changes in non-prod first
- Document all changes
- Have rollback plan
- Communicate changes

**4. Documentation**
- Maintain runbooks
- Document common errors and solutions
- Keep configuration current
- Track known issues

**5. Training**
- Regular admin training
- Knowledge sharing sessions
- Learn from incidents
- Stay current with ISC updates

---

### Escalation Criteria

**When to escalate to SailPoint Support:**

**Escalate immediately (Severity 1):**
- System-wide outage
- Cannot aggregate any sources
- All provisioning failing
- Production impact affecting business

**Escalate within 24 hours (Severity 2):**
- Critical feature not working
- Affecting multiple users/systems
- No known workaround
- Degraded performance impacting operations

**Escalate within 1 week (Severity 3):**
- Non-critical feature issue
- Workaround available
- Enhancement request
- Documentation error

**Don't escalate (handle internally):**
- User error/training issue

### Exam Tips

**Key concepts tested:**
✅ Identifying error category from symptoms
✅ Common causes for each error type
✅ Systematic troubleshooting methodology
✅ When to use manual intervention vs. configuration fix
✅ Prevention strategies
✅ Escalation criteria

**Common exam scenarios:**
- Given error message, identify most likely cause
- Choose appropriate troubleshooting step sequence
- Determine if issue is configuration vs. system bug
- Select best prevention strategy
- Decide when to escalate

**Remember:**
- Connection errors → Check network, VA, credentials
- Correlation errors → Check attribute values, case sensitivity
- Provisioning errors → Check permissions, data, target system
- Role assignment → Check criteria, enabled status, identity refresh
- Access requests → Check requestable flag, approver availability
- Always check obvious things first (enabled, credentials, connectivity)
- Logs are your friend - review them early and often

### Key Takeaways

✅ **Five main error categories**: Aggregation, Correlation, Provisioning, Role Assignment, Access Request

✅ **Systematic approach**: Gather info → Identify category → Check obvious → Review logs → Isolate → Fix → Prevent

✅ **Common patterns**: Connection timeouts, authentication failures, case sensitivity, missing permissions

✅ **Prevention over reaction**: Proactive monitoring, regular maintenance, good change management

✅ **Know when to escalate**: System-wide issues immediately, feature issues within 24hrs, minor issues within week

✅ **Logs are essential**: Always review relevant logs early in troubleshooting process

✅ **Test before production**: Validate changes in non-prod to prevent production issues
