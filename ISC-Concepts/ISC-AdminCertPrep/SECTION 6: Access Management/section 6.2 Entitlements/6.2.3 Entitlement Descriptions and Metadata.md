# 6.2.3 Entitlement Descriptions and Metadata

**Learning Objective:** Understand how to add context and metadata to entitlements to make them meaningful and manageable.

---

## What is Entitlement Metadata?

**Definition:** Additional information and context added to entitlements beyond what is discovered during aggregation

**Key Concept:**
```
Discovered vs. Enhanced:

Discovered (from aggregation):
  - Name: VPN-Users
  - Value: CN=VPN-Users,OU=Groups,DC=company,DC=com
  - Source: Active Directory
  - Members: 450
  
Enhanced (metadata added by admin):
  - Description: "Remote access to corporate network"
  - Owner: IT Operations Team
  - Risk Level: Medium
  - Business Purpose: "Work from home capability"
  - Requestable: Yes
  - Approver: Manager
  - Compliance: SOX controls apply
```

**Why Metadata Matters:**
```
Without metadata:
  User sees: "VPN-Users"
  User thinks: "What is this? Should I request it?"
  Result: Confusion, wrong requests
  
With metadata:
  User sees: "VPN Access - Remote access to corporate network"
  User thinks: "I need this for working from home"
  Result: Clear understanding, correct requests
```

**Exam Tip:** Metadata makes entitlements understandable to users and manageable for admins. Always add descriptions and business context.

---

## Core Entitlement Metadata Fields

### **Description**

**What It Is:**
```
Human-readable explanation of what the entitlement provides

Purpose:
  - Help users understand what they're requesting
  - Help reviewers understand what they're certifying
  - Provide business context
  - Document purpose
```

**Good vs. Bad Descriptions:**

**Bad Description:**
```
Entitlement: VPN-Users
Description: "VPN group"

Problems:
  ✗ Too vague
  ✗ Doesn't explain purpose
  ✗ No business context
  ✗ User still confused
```

**Good Description:**
```
Entitlement: VPN-Users
Description: "Grants remote access to the corporate network via VPN. 
Required for employees who work from home or travel frequently. 
Provides access to internal resources (file shares, applications, 
databases) from outside the office."

Benefits:
  ✓ Clear purpose
  ✓ Business context
  ✓ Use cases explained
  ✓ User understands exactly what it does
```

**Description Best Practices:**
```
Include:
  ✓ What access it grants
  ✓ Why someone would need it
  ✓ What they can do with it
  ✓ Who typically has it
  
Structure:
  1. What: "Grants [specific access]"
  2. Why: "Required for [business need]"
  3. Details: "Provides access to [resources]"
  
Length: 1-3 sentences (100-200 characters ideal)
```

**Examples:**

**Active Directory Groups:**
```
Domain Users:
  "Default group for all Active Directory users. Automatically assigned 
  to every employee. Provides basic domain access and authentication."

Sales-Team:
  "Sales department team members. Grants access to sales shared drives, 
  Salesforce, and sales reporting tools. Required for all sales roles."

Domain Admins:
  "PRIVILEGED: Full administrative access to Active Directory domain. 
  Allows complete control over all AD objects, Group Policies, and domain 
  settings. Restricted to IAM team only. Requires executive approval."

VPN-Users:
  "Remote access to corporate network via VPN. Required for work from 
  home, travel, or remote work. Enables connection to internal resources 
  from any location. Requires manager approval."

Finance-Admins:
  "Administrative access to financial systems and sensitive data. Grants 
  full access to financial applications, reports, and confidential 
  information. Restricted to Finance leadership only."
```

**Salesforce:**
```
Sales Cloud User (Profile):
  "Standard profile for sales team members. Provides access to Accounts, 
  Contacts, Opportunities, and sales reporting. Includes standard CRM 
  functionality. Required for all sales roles."

System Administrator (Profile):
  "PRIVILEGED: Full administrative access to Salesforce. Allows complete 
  configuration, customization, and data access. Restricted to Salesforce 
  admins only. Requires IT Director approval."

Marketing Cloud Access (Permission Set):
  "Grants access to Salesforce Marketing Cloud features. Provides campaign 
  management, email marketing, and analytics capabilities. Required for 
  marketing team members."
```

**AWS:**
```
Developers (IAM Group):
  "Developer access to AWS resources. Grants ability to create and manage 
  EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and development resources. Read-only access 
  to production. Required for software engineering team."

S3ReadOnlyAccess (Policy):
  "Read-only access to S3 buckets. Allows viewing and downloading files 
  but not uploading or deleting. Used for data analysis and reporting 
  needs."
```

### **Business Owner**

**What It Is:**
```
The business person/team responsible for the entitlement

Not technical owner (IT)
Business stakeholder who decides who should have access
```

**Purpose:**
```
✓ Accountability (who decides who gets access)
✓ Certification (who reviews access)
✓ Approval (who approves requests)
✓ Questions (who to ask about access)
```

**Owner Assignment Examples:**
```
VPN-Users:
  Owner: IT Operations
  Why: IT manages VPN infrastructure and policies
  
Sales-Team:
  Owner: Sales Operations Manager
  Why: Sales leader decides who's on sales team
  
Domain Admins:
  Owner: IT Director
  Why: Executive oversight of privileged access
  
Finance-Users:
  Owner: Finance Director
  Why: Finance leader controls finance data access
  
HR-Team:
  Owner: HR Manager
  Why: HR leader decides HR team membership
  
Marketing-Tools:
  Owner: Marketing Operations
  Why: Marketing manages marketing tool access
```

**Owner Responsibilities:**
```
As entitlement owner:
  ✓ Review access requests
  ✓ Approve/deny requests
  ✓ Certify access (periodic reviews)
  ✓ Document business rules
  ✓ Update descriptions as needed
  ✓ Escalate issues
  ✓ Maintain access standards
```

### **Risk Level/Classification**

**What It Is:**
```
Assessment of security risk associated with the entitlement

Levels:
  - Low: Standard business access
  - Medium: Controlled/elevated access
  - High: Privileged/administrative access
  - Critical: Highest privilege (rare)
```

**Risk Level Criteria:**

**Low Risk:**
```
Characteristics:
  ✓ Standard business access
  ✓ Minimal permissions
  ✓ Limited to role-appropriate data
  ✓ No administrative capabilities
  ✓ Widely granted (many people)
  
Examples:
  - Domain Users (AD)
  - Standard User (Salesforce)
  - Department teams (Sales-Team)
  - Basic application access
  
Controls:
  - Manager approval (simple)
  - Annual certification
  - Self-service requestable
```

**Medium Risk:**
```
Characteristics:
  ⚠ Elevated permissions
  ⚠ Broader data access
  ⚠ Remote access capability
  ⚠ Write/modify permissions
  ⚠ Controlled distribution
  
Examples:
  - VPN-Users (remote access)
  - Power User (applications)
  - Department admins
  - Write access to databases
  
Controls:
  - Manager approval required
  - Quarterly certification
  - Justification required
  - Business need validation
```

**High Risk:**
```
Characteristics:
  🔴 Administrative access
  🔴 Privileged permissions
  🔴 Sensitive data access
  🔴 System configuration rights
  🔴 Security impact
  
Examples:
  - Domain Admins (AD)

    ✓ Limited to 3 people
    ✓ Time-limited grants preferred
    ✓ Real-time SIEM monitoring
    ✓ All actions logged and reviewed
    ✓ Background checks required
```

---

### **Privileged Flag**

**What It Is:**
```
Boolean indicator of whether entitlement is privileged

Privileged = Administrative or high-impact access

True/False:
  True: Domain Admins, System Administrator, DBA, Root
  False: Domain Users, Standard User, VPN-Users
```

**Why It Matters:**
```
Privileged entitlements trigger:
  ✓ Special approval workflows
  ✓ Enhanced certification (frequent)
  ✓ Extra monitoring
  ✓ Compliance reporting
  ✓ Audit scrutiny
  ✓ Time-limited grants
  ✓ Executive notifications
```

**Privileged Examples:**
```
Active Directory:
  Privileged = True:
    - Domain Admins
    - Enterprise Admins
    - Schema Admins
    - Account Operators
    - Backup Operators
    - Server Operators
    
  Privileged = False:
    - Domain Users
    - VPN-Users
    - Department teams
    - Standard groups

Salesforce:
  Privileged = True:
    - System Administrator
    - Modify All Data
    - View All Data (depends on context)
    
  Privileged = False:
    - Standard User
    - Sales Cloud User
    - Marketing User

AWS:
  Privileged = True:
    - AdministratorAccess
    - IAMFullAccess
    - PowerUserAccess (some contexts)
    
  Privileged = False:
    - S3ReadOnlyAccess
    - EC2ReadOnlyAccess
    - ViewOnlyAccess
```

---

### **Requestable**

**What It Is:**
```
Whether users can request this entitlement via self-service

Yes/No:
  Yes: Appears in access request catalog
  No: Not requestable (automatic or restricted)
```

**When Requestable = Yes:**
```
Appropriate for:
  ✓ Standard business access
  ✓ Role-based access
  ✓ Application access
  ✓ Department teams
  ✓ Common needs
  
Examples:
  - VPN-Users (users request as needed)
  - Sales-Team (new sales hires request)
  - Application access groups
  - Report access
```

**When Requestable = No:**
```
Appropriate for:
  ✗ Automatic/default groups (Domain Users)
  ✗ Highly privileged access (Domain Admins)
  ✗ Role-assigned only (automated)
  ✗ Special process required
  
Examples:
  - Domain Users (automatic, everyone gets it)
  - Domain Admins (special approval process, not self-service)
  - Birthright access (automatically granted)
```

**Requestable Configuration:**
```
VPN-Users:
  Requestable: Yes
  Approval: Manager
  Justification: Required
  
  User can:
    1. Browse access catalog
    2. Select "VPN Access"
    3. Provide justification: "Work from home 3 days/week"
    4. Submit request
    5. Manager approves
    6. Access granted automatically

Domain Admins:
  Requestable: No
  
  Why:
    - Too privileged for self-service
    - Special approval process
    - Executive approval required
    - Background check needed
    - Alternative process:
      → Email to IT Director
      → Detailed justification
      → Executive review
      → Manual grant if approved
```

---

### **Approver/Approval Workflow**

**What It Is:**
```
Who must approve requests for this entitlement

Can be:
  - Manager (default)
  - Entitlement Owner
  - Specific person/role
  - Multi-level approval
  - Conditional approval
```

**Approval Examples:**

**Single Approver:**
```
VPN-Users:
  Approver: Manager
  
  Workflow:
    User requests → Manager approves/denies → Provision
    
Sales-Team:
  Approver: Sales Manager
  
  Workflow:
    User requests → Sales Manager approves → Provision
```

**Multi-Level Approval:**
```
Domain Admins:
  Approvers:
    1. Manager (first level)
    2. IT Director (second level)
    3. CISO (third level)
    
  Workflow:
    User requests 
    → Manager approves 
    → IT Director approves 
    → CISO approves 
    → Provision
    
    If any deny → Request denied
```

**Owner as Approver:**
```
Finance-Admin:
  Owner: Finance Director
  Approver: Same as owner (Finance Director)
  
  Workflow:
    User requests 
    → Finance Director approves 
    → Provision
    
  Rationale:
    Owner decides who gets finance data access
```

---

### **Compliance/Regulatory Tags**

**What It Is:**
```
Indicators of compliance/regulatory scope

Tags:
  - SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley)
  - PCI (Payment Card Industry)
  - HIPAA (Healthcare)
  - GDPR (Privacy)
  - SOC2 (Security controls)
  - ITAR (Export control)
```

**Why It Matters:**
```
Compliance-tagged entitlements require:
  ✓ Enhanced certification (more frequent)
  ✓ Stricter controls
  ✓ Detailed audit trails
  ✓ Compliance reporting
  ✓ Regulatory documentation
```

**Examples:**
```
Domain Admins:
  Compliance Tags: SOX, SOC2, PCI
  
  Why:
    - SOX: Financial system access control
    - SOC2: Security control testing
    - PCI: Cardholder data environment access
    
  Impact:
    - Monthly certification required
    - Detailed audit logs
    - Quarterly compliance reports
    - Auditor review

Payroll-Access:
  Compliance Tags: SOX, Privacy
  
  Why:
    - SOX: Financial data (payroll is financial)
    - Privacy: Personal employee information
    
  Impact:
    - Quarterly certification
    - Privacy impact assessment
    - Restricted access
    - Audit trail required

HIPAA-Data-Access:
  Compliance Tags: HIPAA
  
  Why:
    - HIPAA: Protected Health Information (PHI)
    
  Impact:
    - HIPAA training required
    - Business associate agreements
    - Enhanced security
    - Breach notification procedures
```

---

### **Certification Frequency**

**What It Is:**
```
How often access to this entitlement should be reviewed/certified

Options:
  - Not certified (automatic groups)
  - Annual (low risk)
  - Quarterly (standard)
  - Monthly (high risk)
  - Weekly (critical)
  - Daily (emergency access)
```

**Frequency by Risk:**
```
Low Risk:
  Certification: Annual
  Examples: Department teams, standard access
  
Medium Risk:
  Certification: Quarterly
  Examples: VPN-Users, application access
  
High Risk:
  Certification: Monthly
  Examples: Domain Admins, DBA, privileged access
  
Critical:
  Certification: Weekly or Daily
  Examples: Emergency admin accounts, production access
```

**Example:**
```
Domain Admins:
  Certification Frequency: Monthly
  Reviewer: IT Director + CISO
  
  Process:
    Every 30 days:
      1. Campaign launched automatically
      2. IT Director reviews all members
      3. CISO co-reviews
      4. Each member certified or revoked
      5. Results documented
      6. Report to audit
      
VPN-Users:
  Certification Frequency: Quarterly
  Reviewer: Manager
  
  Process:
    Every 90 days:
      1. Managers certify their team members
      2. Review: Still need VPN access?
      3. Certify (retain) or Revoke (remove)
      4. Auto-provisioning based on decisions
```

## Adding Metadata in ISC

### **Manual Metadata Entry**

**How to Add Descriptions:**
```
Step 1: Navigate to Entitlements
  Admin → Entitlements
  
Step 2: Search for entitlement
  Search: VPN-Users
  Source: Active Directory
  
Step 3: Edit entitlement
  Click: VPN-Users
  Click: Edit
  
Step 4: Add metadata
  Description: 
    "Remote access to corporate network via VPN. Required for 
    employees who work from home or travel. Provides access to 
    internal resources from any location."
    
  Owner: IT Operations
  
  Risk Level: Medium
  
  Privileged: No
  
  Requestable: Yes
  
  Approver: Manager
  
  Certification Frequency: Quarterly
  
  Compliance Tags: None
  
Step 5: Save
  Click: Save
  
Result:
  ✓ Metadata saved
  ✓ Visible to users in catalog
  ✓ Used in access requests
  ✓ Used in certifications
```

---

### **Bulk Metadata Import**

**For Large Entitlement Catalogs:**
```
Scenario: 250 AD groups need metadata

Option 1: Manual (one by one)
  Time: 5 minutes per entitlement
  Total: 250 × 5 = 1,250 minutes (21 hours!)
  Not practical ✗

Option 2: CSV Import
  Time: 2 hours (prepare CSV + import)
  Much more efficient ✓

CSV Template:
  entitlement_name,source,description,owner,risk_level,privileged,requestable,approver
  Domain Users,Active Directory,"Default group for all users",IT Operations,Low,No,No,
  VPN-Users,Active Directory,"Remote VPN access",IT Operations,Medium,No,Yes,Manager
  Domain Admins,Active Directory,"Full AD admin access",IT Director,High,Yes,No,IT Director
  Sales-Team,Active Directory,"Sales department members",Sales Ops,Low,No,Yes,Sales Manager
  ...

Process:
  1. Export entitlement list from ISC
  2. Add metadata columns in Excel
  3. Fill in metadata for each entitlement
  4. Save as CSV
  5. Import CSV to ISC
  6. Review and validate
  7. Publish

Result:
  ✓ 250 entitlements with metadata
  ✓ 2 hours vs. 21 hours
  ✓ Consistent and complete
```

---

## Metadata Best Practices

### **Completeness**

**Minimum Required Metadata:**
```
For every entitlement:
  ✓ Description (what it does)
  ✓ Owner (who manages it)
  ✓ Risk level (low/medium/high)
  ✓ Requestable (yes/no)
  
Without these, entitlements are not usable
```

**Enhanced Metadata (Recommended):**
```
Additionally include:
  ✓ Business purpose
  ✓ Approval workflow
  ✓ Certification frequency
  ✓ Compliance tags (if applicable)
  ✓ Usage guidelines
  ✓ Examples of who should have it
```

---

### **Clarity**

**Write for Your Audience:**
```
Users reading catalog:
  - Business language (not technical)
  - Clear purpose
  - Use cases
  
Example:
  Bad: "memberOf CN=VPN-Users,OU=Groups,DC=company,DC=com"
  Good: "VPN Access - Work remotely from home or while traveling"
```

**Reviewers certifying access:**
```
Provide context for certification:
  - What access it grants
  - Why someone would need it
  - What they can do with it
  
Helps reviewers make informed decisions
```

---

### **Consistency**

**Standard Format:**
```
Use consistent structure across all descriptions:

Template:
  "[Access Type] - [Business Purpose]. [Details]. [Typical Users]."

Examples:
  "Remote VPN Access - Work from home or travel. Connects to internal 
   network from any location. Required for remote employees."
   
  "Sales Team Membership - Sales department access. Grants access to 
   CRM, sales drives, and reporting tools. Required for all sales roles."
   
  "Finance Administrator - Financial system administration. Full access 
   to GL, AP, AR systems. Restricted to Finance leadership only."
```

---

### **Accuracy**

**Keep Metadata Current:**
```
Review and update:
  ✓ Quarterly for all entitlements
  ✓ When business changes (reorg, new systems)
  ✓ When ownership changes
  ✓ When compliance requirements change
  
Outdated metadata = Confusion and errors
```

---

## Practice Exercise

**Question:** You've just aggregated Active Directory and discovered 250 groups. The entitlement "Finance-Admin" (15 members) grants full access to all financial systems and data. What metadata should you add and why?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Complete Metadata Configuration for Finance-Admin:**

---

**Entitlement: Finance-Admin**

**Discovered Information (from aggregation):**
```
Name: Finance-Admin
Value: CN=Finance-Admin,OU=Groups,DC=company,DC=com
Type: group
Source: Active Directory
Attribute: memberOf
Members: 15 accounts
Status: Active

Missing: All business context and metadata!
```

---

**Required Metadata to Add:**

**1. Description (Critical):**
```
Recommended:
  "PRIVILEGED: Full administrative access to all financial systems 
  including General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, 
  and financial reporting. Grants ability to post journal entries, 
  process payments, modify chart of accounts, and access all financial 
  data. Restricted to Finance department leadership and designated 
  financial system administrators only."

Why this description:
  ✓ Clearly indicates privileged access (PRIVILEGED:)
  ✓ Specifies what systems (GL, AP, AR)
  ✓ Details capabilities (post entries, process payments)
  ✓ Indicates who should have it (Finance leadership)
  ✓ Provides business context
  ✓ Helps users understand if they need it
  ✓ Helps certifiers review appropriately

Structure used:
  1. Privilege warning: "PRIVILEGED:"
  2. Systems: "all financial systems including..."
  3. Capabilities: "Grants ability to..."
  4. Restrictions: "Restricted to..."
```

**2. Business Owner (Critical):**
```
Recommended:
  Owner: Finance Director
  
Why:
  ✓ Finance Director owns financial systems
  ✓ Decides who needs finance admin access
  ✓ Accountable for finance data security
  ✓ Reviews certifications
  ✓ Approves access requests
  ✓ Escalation point for questions
  
Owner's Responsibilities:
  - Review all access requests for Finance-Admin
  - Certify access monthly
  - Ensure only appropriate people have access
  - Document business justifications
  - Manage finance system access policies
```

**3. Risk Level (Critical):**
```
Recommended:
  Risk Level: High
  
Why High Risk:
  🔴 Full admin access to financial systems
  🔴 Can modify financial data
  🔴 Can post fraudulent transactions
  🔴 Access to sensitive financial information
  🔴 SOX critical access
  🔴 Audit materiality
  🔴 Regulatory impact (SEC, IRS)
  🔴 Potential for financial fraud
  🔴 Reputational risk
  
Not Critical because:
  - Limited to 15 people (controlled)
  - Finance domain only (not enterprise-wide like Domain Admins)
  - Specific business function
  
But definitely High:
  - Administrative capabilities
  - Sensitive data
  - Compliance critical
  - Fraud risk
```

**4. Privileged Flag (Critical):**
```
Recommended:
  Privileged: Yes
  
Why:
  ✓ Administrative access (not standard user)
  ✓ Full control over financial systems
  ✓ Can modify critical business data
  ✓ High security impact
  ✓ Requires special controls
  
Impact of Privileged = Yes:
  - Triggers enhanced approval workflow
  - Requires frequent certification
  - Enhanced monitoring
  - Compliance reporting
  - Executive visibility
  - Audit scrutiny
```

**5. Requestable (Important):**
```
Recommended:
  Requestable: No
  
Why NOT Self-Service:
  ✗ Too privileged for self-service
  ✗ Requires detailed vetting
  ✗ Background check may be needed
  ✗ Compliance verification required
  ✗ Alternative process more appropriate
  
Alternative Process:
  Instead of self-service request:
    1. Employee discusses need with manager
    2. Manager discusses with Finance Director
    3. Finance Director evaluates:
       - Business need genuine?
       - Role appropriate?
       - Background check clear?
       - Training completed?
    4. If approved, Finance Director emails IT
    5. IT manually provisions after verification
    6. All steps documented
    
More controlled than self-service
```

**6. Approval Workflow (Critical):**
```
Recommended (if making requestable later):
  Approvers:
    1. Manager (first level)
    2. Finance Director (second level)
    3. CFO (third level - for permanent access)
    
  Workflow:
    User requests (if enabled)
    → Manager reviews and approves
    → Finance Director reviews business need
    → CFO approves for permanent grant
    → IT provisions after all approvals
    
  Time-Limited Alternative:
    - Request temporary access (4 hours)
    - Finance Director approval only
    - Auto-revoke after time expires
    - Better for one-time needs

Current Recommendation:
  Given requestable = No, document expected process:
    "Access granted by Finance Director approval via email to IT. 
    Requires business justification, manager approval, and CFO 
    approval for permanent grants."
```

**7. Certification Frequency (Critical):**
```
Recommended:
  Certification Frequency: Monthly
  
Why Monthly (not quarterly):
  🔴 Highly privileged access
  🔴 SOX critical (financial reporting)
  🔴 High fraud risk
  🔴 Limited members (15 - manageable monthly)
  🔴 Compliance requirements
  🔴 Executive expectations
  
Certification Process:
  Every 30 days:
    1. Campaign launches automatically
    2. Finance Director reviews all 15 members
    3. For each member:
       - Still in appropriate role?
       - Still needs admin access?
       - Any concerns or incidents?
       - Certify (retain) or Revoke (remove)
    4. Results documented
    5. Report sent to CFO
    6. Audit trail maintained
    
Benefit:
  - Tight control over privileged finance access
  - Frequent validation
  - Quick detection of inappropriate access
  - Compliance demonstration
```

**8. Compliance/Regulatory Tags (Critical):**
```
Recommended:
  Compliance Tags: SOX, SOC2, Audit
  
Why:
  SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley):
    ✓ Financial reporting controls
    ✓ Access to GL and financial systems
    ✓ Segregation of duties
    ✓ Quarterly attestation
    ✓ Auditor review required
    
  SOC2 (Security Controls):
    ✓ Access control testing
    ✓ Privileged access management
    ✓ Change management
    ✓ Audit trail requirements
    
  Audit:
    ✓ Internal audit review
    ✓ External audit scope
    ✓ Compliance testing
    
Impact:
  - Included in SOX testing
  - Quarterly access reviews for auditors
  - Enhanced documentation required
  - Audit trail must be complete
  - Any access changes reported
```

**9. Additional Metadata (Recommended):**

**Business Purpose:**
```
Business Purpose:
  "Administration of enterprise financial systems. Required for Finance 
  leadership, financial system administrators, and designated finance 
  operations staff who must post journal entries, process payments, 
  close financial periods, and maintain chart of accounts."

Use:
  - Helps requester understand if appropriate
  - Guides certification decisions
  - Documents business justification
```

**Prerequisites:**
```
Prerequisites:
  ☑ Finance department employee
  ☑ Finance leadership approval
  ☑ Background check (within 1 year)
  ☑ Financial systems training completed
  ☑ SOX compliance training completed
  ☑ Manager approval

```

**For Certifications:**
```
Monthly certification:
  1. Finance Director sees all 15 members

Better certification decisions
```

## Section Summary

**Core Concepts for Certification:**

✅ **Entitlement Metadata Purpose:**
- Provides business context to technical entitlements
- Makes entitlements understandable to users
- Enables effective access governance
- Supports compliance requirements

✅ **Core Metadata Fields:**
- **Description**: What it does, why needed, who should have it
- **Owner**: Business person/team responsible
- **Risk Level**: Low/Medium/High/Critical
- **Privileged**: Yes/No (administrative access)
- **Requestable**: Yes/No (self-service available)
- **Approver**: Who approves requests
- **Certification Frequency**: How often reviewed

✅ **Good Description Contains:**
- What access it grants
- Why someone would need it
- What they can do with it
- Who typically has it
- 100-200 characters, 1-3 sentences

✅ **Risk Levels:**
- **Low**: Standard access, minimal permissions
- **Medium**: Elevated access, controlled distribution
- **High**: Privileged access, administrative rights
- **Critical**: Highest privileges, extreme sensitivity

✅ **Privileged Entitlements:**
- Flagged as Privileged = Yes
- Administrative or high-impact access
- Require enhanced controls:
  - Multi-level approval
  - Frequent certification (monthly)
  - Enhanced monitoring
  - Compliance tags (SOX, etc.)

✅ **Metadata Best Practices:**
- Complete: All core fields populated
- Clear: Business language, not technical jargon
- Consistent: Standard format across all entitlements
- Current: Review and update quarterly
- Accurate: Reflects reality

**Exam Focus Areas:**
- Know metadata provides business context
- Understand description format (what/why/who)
- Remember risk levels (low/medium/high)
- Know privileged entitlements need special metadata
- Understand owner = business person (not IT)
- Remember compliance tags trigger enhanced controls
- Know to add metadata immediately after discovery

- **Description**: What it does + why needed + who should have it
- **Owner**: Business person (Finance Director, Sales Manager)
- **Risk**: Low (standard), Medium (elevated), High (admin)
- **Privileged**: Yes = admin access, needs special controls
- **Complete**: Every entitlement needs description + owner + risk
- **After aggregation**: Immediately add metadata to privileged groups
