# 6.3.1 Different Types of Access in SailPoint

**Learning Objective:** Understand the various ways access can be granted and managed in SailPoint ISC.

---

## Access Types Overview

**Definition:** The different methods and mechanisms by which users receive access to systems and resources

**Key Concept:**
```
Access can be granted through multiple methods:

1. Direct Assignment (individual entitlements)
2. Role-Based (via roles)
3. Access Profiles (bundled access)
4. Automated (lifecycle/birthright)
5. Requested (self-service)
6. Manual (admin provisioning)
```

**Exam Tip:** Understand the difference between direct access (individual entitlements), role-based access (via roles), and access profiles (curated bundles). Each serves different purposes.

---

## Access Type 1: Direct Access

### **What is Direct Access?**

**Definition:** Individual entitlements granted directly to an account, not through a role or bundle

**Simple Explanation:**
```
Direct Access = Specific entitlement assigned to specific person

Example:
  John Smith → VPN-Users group (direct assignment)
  
Not via role, not via bundle
Just the entitlement itself
```

**Characteristics:**
```
✓ One-off assignments
✓ Individual entitlements
✓ Not bundled with other access
✓ Explicit grant
✓ Visible as direct assignment
```

---

### **Direct Access Examples**

**Active Directory Example:**
```
Identity: John Smith

Direct Access:
  Account: Active Directory (john.smith)
  Entitlements (direct):
    - VPN-Users ← Directly granted
    - Sales-Team ← Directly granted
    - Project-Alpha ← Directly granted (temporary project)
    
How granted:
  - User requested VPN-Users (approved)
  - User requested Sales-Team (approved)
  - Manager granted Project-Alpha (special project)
  
Not through role:
  - These are individual, standalone grants
  - No role involved
```

**Salesforce Example:**
```
Identity: Jane Doe

Direct Access:
  Account: Salesforce (jane.doe@company.com)
  Profile: Sales Cloud User ← Direct assignment
  Permission Sets (direct):
    - Marketing Cloud Access ← Directly granted
    - Advanced Reporting ← Directly granted
    
How granted:
  - Admin assigned Sales Cloud User profile
  - User requested Marketing Cloud Access (approved)
  - Manager requested Advanced Reporting (approved)
```

---

### **When to Use Direct Access**

**Appropriate Scenarios:**
```
✓ Temporary access (project-based)
✓ One-off requests
✓ Exception cases
✓ Individual needs not covered by roles
✓ Testing/troubleshooting
```

**Examples:**

**Temporary Project Access:**
```
Scenario:
  Employee: Bob Wilson (IT Department)
  Need: Access to Finance shared drive for special project
  Duration: 3 months
  
Solution: Direct access
  Grant: Finance-Share-Read (direct entitlement)
  Reason: Temporary, project-specific, not role-based
  
After 3 months:
  Revoke Finance-Share-Read
  Bob returns to normal IT access
```

**Exception Access:**
```
Scenario:
  Employee: Alice Chen (Marketing)
  Need: Access to Sales reports (unusual for marketing)
  Reason: Special campaign requires sales data
  
Solution: Direct access
  Grant: Sales-Reports-Access (direct entitlement)
  Reason: Exception, not typical for marketing role
  
Note: Not added to Marketing role (exception, not standard)
```

---

### **Direct Access Challenges**

**Access Sprawl:**
```
Problem:
  Everyone has different direct entitlements
  Hard to manage
  Difficult to certify
  No consistency
  
Example:
  Sales Rep 1: VPN, Salesforce, Sales-Team, Marketing-Tools
  Sales Rep 2: VPN, Salesforce, Sales-Team, HR-Reports
  Sales Rep 3: VPN, Salesforce, Finance-Share
  
  Why different? All sales reps should have same access!
  
Solution: Use roles instead (covered later)
```

**Certification Difficulty:**
```
Problem:
  Each person has unique mix of direct entitlements
  Manager must review each individual entitlement
  Lots of decisions
  
Example:
  Manager certifying John Smith:
    - VPN-Users: Certify or Revoke?
    - Sales-Team: Certify or Revoke?
    - Project-Alpha: Certify or Revoke?
    - Finance-Reports: Certify or Revoke?
    - Marketing-Tools: Certify or Revoke?
    
  5 decisions for one person × 50 people = 250 decisions!
  
Better: Role-based (1 decision per person)
```

---

## Access Type 2: Role-Based Access

### **What is Role-Based Access?**

**Definition:** Access granted through assignment to a business role that bundles multiple entitlements

**Simple Explanation:**
```
Role = Collection of entitlements for a job function

Example:
  Role: "Sales Representative"
  Includes:
    - VPN-Users (AD)
    - Sales-Team (AD)
    - Salesforce (Salesforce profile)
    - Sales-Reports (Report access)
    
  Assign user to role → Gets all entitlements automatically
```

**Key Concept:**
```
Identity → Role → Multiple Entitlements

Example:
  John Smith → "Sales Representative" role
    ↓
  Entitlements:
    - VPN-Users
    - Sales-Team
    - Salesforce
    - Sales-Reports
    
All granted together via role assignment
```

---

### **Role-Based Access Examples**

**Sales Representative Role:**
```
Role Name: Sales Representative

Entitlements Included:
  Active Directory:
    - Domain Users (automatic)
    - VPN-Users
    - Sales-Team
    - All-Employees
    
  Salesforce:
    - Sales Cloud User (profile)
    
  File Shares:
    - Sales-Shared-Drive
    
  Applications:
    - CRM-Access
    - Sales-Reports-Access
    
Total: 8 entitlements bundled in one role

Assignment:
  New sales hire: John Smith
  Assign: "Sales Representative" role
  Result: John gets all 8 entitlements automatically
  
Benefit:
  - One assignment (role)
  - Multiple entitlements granted
  - Consistent access for all sales reps
  - Easy to manage
```

**IT Administrator Role:**
```
Role Name: IT Administrator

Entitlements Included:
  Active Directory:
    - Domain Admins (privileged)
    - IT-Team
    - Server-Admins
    
  ServiceNow:
    - ITIL Admin (profile)
    
  Monitoring Tools:
    - Splunk-Admin
    - Nagios-Admin
    
  Servers:
    - Linux-Root (multiple servers)
    - Windows-Admin (multiple servers)
    
Total: 10+ entitlements

Assignment:
  New IT admin: Sarah Williams
  Assign: "IT Administrator" role
  Result: Sarah gets all admin access
  
Approval:
  - IT Director approval
  - CISO approval
  - Background check
  (Privileged role requires enhanced approval)
```

---

### **Role Assignment Methods**

**Manual Assignment:**
```
Process:
  1. Admin identifies user needs role
  2. Admin assigns role in ISC
  3. Approval workflow (if required)
  4. Role assigned
  5. All entitlements provisioned
  
Example:
  New hire: Bob Wilson
  Job: Sales Representative
  
  Admin action:
    Admin → Identities → Bob Wilson
    Assign Role → Sales Representative
    Submit
    
  Approval:
    Manager approves
    
  Result:
    Bob gets all Sales Representative entitlements
```

**Automated Assignment (Role Mining):**
```
Process:
  1. Set criteria for role assignment
  2. ISC automatically assigns role when criteria met
  3. Provisions entitlements
  
Example:
  Rule: IF department = "Sales" THEN assign "Sales Representative"
  
  New hire aggregated from Workday:
    Name: Alice Johnson
    Department: Sales ← Triggers rule
    
  ISC automatically:
    Assigns "Sales Representative" role
    Provisions all role entitlements
    
  User has access day one
```

---

### **Benefits of Role-Based Access**

**Consistency:**
```
Problem (Direct Access):
  Sales Rep 1: 8 different entitlements
  Sales Rep 2: 7 different entitlements
  Sales Rep 3: 9 different entitlements
  
  Why different? Should be same!

Solution (Role-Based):
  All sales reps: "Sales Representative" role
  All get exact same entitlements
  Consistent access ✓
```

**Simplified Certification:**
```
Problem (Direct Access):
  Certify each entitlement individually
  Sales rep with 8 entitlements = 8 decisions
  
Solution (Role-Based):
  Certify role membership
  "Should Bob still be Sales Representative?" = 1 decision
  
  Result:
    - 50 sales reps
    - Direct access: 50 × 8 = 400 decisions
    - Role-based: 50 × 1 = 50 decisions
    - 88% fewer decisions ✓
```

**Easy Onboarding:**
```
New Hire:
  Direct access: Manually request 8+ entitlements
  Role-based: Assign 1 role, get all entitlements
  
  Time saved: Hours → Minutes
```

**Easy Offboarding:**
```
Termination:
  Direct access: Revoke 8+ entitlements individually
  Role-based: Remove 1 role, revokes all entitlements
  
  Complete and fast
```

---

## Access Type 3: Access Profiles

### **What are Access Profiles?**

**Definition:** Curated bundles of related entitlements that can be requested and managed as a unit

**Simple Explanation:**
```
Access Profile = Pre-packaged set of entitlements

Similar to role, but:
  - More focused (specific application/system)
  - User-requestable
  - Not necessarily job-based
  - Can have multiple profiles
  
Example:
  Access Profile: "Salesforce Sales User"
  Includes:
    - Salesforce Sales Cloud User profile
    - Salesforce Mobile app access
    - Salesforce Reports access
    
  User can request this profile
  Gets all three entitlements together
```

---

### **Access Profile vs. Role**

**Key Differences:**

**Role (Job-Based):**
```
Purpose: Define access for job function
Scope: Cross-system (AD, Salesforce, apps, etc.)
Assignment: Usually automatic (based on job)
Example: "Sales Representative" role
  - Includes access across multiple systems
  - Defines what sales rep needs to do job
  - Assigned based on job title/department
```

**Access Profile (Application-Based):**
```
Purpose: Bundle related application access
Scope: Single system or related systems
Assignment: Usually requested (self-service)
Example: "Salesforce Sales User" access profile
  - Includes Salesforce-specific access only
  - Defines Salesforce usage pattern
  - User requests when needed
```

**Comparison:**

| Aspect | Role | Access Profile |
|--------|------|----------------|
| **Scope** | Cross-system (entire job) | System-specific |
| **Purpose** | Job function | Application usage |
| **Assignment** | Automated (job-based) | Requested (need-based) |
| **Contains** | 10-20+ entitlements | 3-7 entitlements |
| **Example** | Sales Representative | Salesforce Sales User |
| **Quantity** | Users have 1-3 roles | Users have 5-10 profiles |

---

### **Access Profile Examples**

**Salesforce Sales User Profile:**
```
Access Profile Name: Salesforce Sales User

```

---

### **When to Use Access Profiles**

**Appropriate Scenarios:**
```
✓ Application-specific access bundles
✓ Common request patterns
✓ Self-service access requests
✓ Temporary access needs
✓ Cross-functional access
```

**Examples:**

**Common Request Pattern:**
```
Observation:
  Many users request same 3 Salesforce entitlements:
    1. Sales Cloud User profile
    2. Mobile App access
    3. Report Builder
    
Problem:
  Users make 3 separate requests
  3 separate approvals
  Time-consuming
  
Solution: Create Access Profile
  Profile: "Salesforce Sales User"
  Includes all 3 entitlements
  
  Now:
    User makes 1 request
    Manager makes 1 approval
    User gets all 3 entitlements
    
  Faster and easier ✓
```

**Temporary Access:**
```
Scenario:
  Marketing employee needs temporary finance data access
  Project: Q4 marketing campaign analysis
  Duration: 1 month
  
Solution: Access Profile
  Request: "Finance Reporting Access" profile
  Approval: Finance Manager
  Duration: 30 days (time-limited)
  
After 30 days:
  Auto-revoke all entitlements in profile
  Clean and automatic
```

---

## Access Type 4: Birthright Access

### **What is Birthright Access?**

**Definition:** Access automatically granted to all employees (or all employees in a role/department) without request

**Simple Explanation:**
```
Birthright = Automatic access everyone gets

Example:
  Every employee automatically gets:
    - Active Directory account
    - Email
    - VPN access (if remote workforce)
    - Company intranet
    
  No request needed
  Granted on day one
  Part of being an employee
```

**Characteristics:**
```
✓ Automatic (no request)
✓ Universal (everyone or everyone in category)
✓ Immediate (day one)
✓ Standard (baseline access)
```

---

### **Birthright Access Examples**

**Universal Birthright (Everyone):**
```
All Active Employees:
  
  Automatically get:
    - Active Directory account
    - Email account
    - Employee portal access
    - Building badge
    - Intranet access
    
  No request required
  Provisioned during onboarding
  Standard for all employees
```

**Department Birthright:**
```
All Sales Employees:
  
  Automatically get:
    - Universal birthright (above)
    - Plus: Salesforce Sales Cloud User
    - Plus: Sales shared drive access
    - Plus: CRM-Tools access
    
  Automatic based on department = "Sales"
  Part of being in sales
  
All IT Employees:
  
  Automatically get:
    - Universal birthright
    - Plus: ServiceNow access
    - Plus: IT tools access
    - Plus: Monitoring systems access
    
  Automatic based on department = "IT"
```

**Location Birthright:**
```
All US Employees:
  
  Automatically get:
    - US payroll system access
    - US benefits portal
    - US compliance training
    
All EMEA Employees:
  
  Automatically get:
    - EMEA payroll system access
    - EMEA benefits portal
    - GDPR training
    
  Automatic based on location
```

---

### **Implementing Birthright Access**

**Via Roles:**
```
Method: Create birthright role

Example:
  Role: "Employee - Birthright"
  
  Entitlements:
    - Active Directory account
    - Email
    - VPN-Users
    - Intranet-Access
    - Employee-Portal
    
  Assignment Rule:
    IF cloudLifecycleState = "active"
    THEN assign "Employee - Birthright" role
    
  Result:
    All active employees automatically get role
    All birthright access provisioned
    No manual intervention
```

**Via Lifecycle Events:**
```
Method: Joiner workflow

Example:
  Lifecycle Change: prehire → active (joiner)
  
  Workflow triggers:
    1. Create AD account
    2. Create email account
    3. Add to VPN-Users group
    4. Grant intranet access
    5. Provision employee portal
    
  All automatic
  Day one access
```

---

## Access Type 5: Requested Access

### **What is Requested Access?**

**Definition:** Access granted through self-service request and approval process

**Simple Explanation:**
```
User needs access:
  1. User logs into ISC
  2. Browses access catalog
  3. Requests access (with justification)
  4. Manager approves
  5. Access provisioned automatically
  
Self-service with approval control
```

---

### **Request Process**

**Step-by-Step:**
```
Step 1: User identifies need
  "I need VPN access to work from home"
  
Step 2: User browses catalog
  ISC → Request Access
  Browse available access
  Find: "VPN Remote Access"
  
Step 3: User submits request
  Access: VPN Remote Access
  Justification: "Work from home 3 days per week"
  Business Need: "Remote work arrangement"
  Submit
  
Step 4: Approval workflow
  Request → Manager (auto-routed)
  Manager reviews:
    - Does employee need VPN?
    - Is justification valid?
    - Business need appropriate?
  Manager: Approve
  
Step 5: Provisioning
  ISC automatically provisions VPN access
  Adds user to VPN-Users group
  Enables MFA if needed
  
Step 6: Notification
  Email to user: "Your VPN access has been granted"
  User can connect via VPN
  
Duration: 15 minutes - 2 business days (depends on approval)
```

---

### **Requestable Access Types**

**Individual Entitlements:**
```
User can request single entitlements:
  - VPN-Users group
  - Sales-Team group
  - Specific application access
  
Granular requests
Good for one-off needs
```

**Access Profiles:**
```
User can request bundled access:
  - "Salesforce Sales User" (3 entitlements)
  - "Finance Reporting Access" (3 entitlements)
  - "VPN Remote Access" (3 entitlements)
  
Convenient for common patterns
One request, multiple entitlements
```

**Roles:**
```
User can request roles (if enabled):
  - "Sales Representative" (8+ entitlements)
  - "Marketing Analyst" (10+ entitlements)
  
Usually restricted:
  - Roles often auto-assigned (job-based)
  - Request typically for role changes
  - Higher-level approval
```

---

## Access Type 6: Manual/Admin Provisioning

### **What is Manual Provisioning?**

**Definition:** Access granted directly by administrator, bypassing normal request process

**When Used:**
```
✓ Emergency access
✓ Troubleshooting
✓ Testing
✓ Executive requests
✓ System accounts
✓ Break-glass access
```

**Examples:**

**Emergency Access:**
```
Scenario:
  Critical system down
  Need immediate admin access
  No time for approval workflow
  
Action:
  Admin directly provisions:
    - Grant Domain Admins (temporary)
    - Duration: 4 hours
    - Reason: "Emergency - Production outage"
    
  After 4 hours:
    Auto-revoke access
    Document emergency use
```

**Executive Request:**
```
Scenario:
  CEO needs immediate access to sales reports
  Board meeting in 30 minutes
  
Action:
  Admin directly provisions:
    - Grant Sales-Reports-Access
    - Bypass approval (executive)
    - Document: "CEO request for board meeting"
    
  Later:
    Retrospective approval from appropriate manager
```

## Access Type Comparison

### **Summary Matrix**

| Access Type | How Granted | Scope | Use Case | Certification |
|-------------|-------------|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Direct** | Individual entitlement | Single entitlement | Exceptions, temporary | Per entitlement |
| **Role-Based** | Role assignment | Multiple entitlements (job) | Standard job functions | Per role |
| **Access Profile** | Request bundle | Multiple entitlements (app) | Common request patterns | Per profile |
| **Birthright** | Automatic | Standard access | All employees/departments | Usually not certified |
| **Requested** | Self-service request | Varies | On-demand needs | Per request |
| **Manual** | Admin provision | Varies | Emergency, exceptions | Out-of-band |

---

### **Which Type to Use?**

**Decision Tree:**
```
Need: User needs access

Question 1: Is this standard for everyone?
  YES → Birthright Access
    Example: Email, intranet (all employees)
    
  NO → Continue to Question 2

Question 2: Is this standard for this job function?
  YES → Role-Based Access
    Example: Sales rep needs Salesforce (all sales reps)
    
  NO → Continue to Question 3

Question 3: Is this a common request pattern?
  YES → Access Profile
    Example: Many users request same 3 Salesforce entitlements
    
  NO → Continue to Question 4

Question 4: Is this one-off or temporary?
  YES → Direct Access (via request)
    Example: Temporary project access
    
  NO → Continue to Question 5

Question 5: Is this emergency or urgent?
  YES → Manual/Admin Provisioning
    Example: Production outage, need immediate admin access
    
  NO → Default to requested access or role-based
```

---

**Scenario 1: All Employees Need Email and Intranet Access**

**Recommended: Birthright Access**

**Analysis:**
```
Characteristics:
  - All employees need it
  - Universal requirement
  - Standard access
  - No exceptions
  - Needed from day one
  
Fits Birthright Access:
  ✓ Everyone gets it automatically
  ✓ No request needed
  ✓ Part of being an employee
  ✓ Provisioned during onboarding
```

**Implementation:**
```
Method 1: Birthright Role

Create role: "Employee - Birthright"
  
Entitlements:
  - Email account (Exchange/O365)
  - Intranet access (SharePoint/portal)
  - Active Directory account (if not already)
  - Employee directory access
  - Company announcements
  
Assignment Rule:
  IF cloudLifecycleState = "active"
  THEN assign "Employee - Birthright" role
  
Result:
  - All active employees automatically get role
  - All entitlements provisioned
  - No manual intervention

Method 2: Joiner Workflow

Lifecycle Event: prehire → active (joiner)

Workflow:
  1. Create email account
  2. Grant intranet access
  3. Add to All-Employees group
  4. Send welcome email
  
Result:
  - Day one access
  - Automatic provisioning
  - Consistent for all new hires
```

**Benefits:**
```
✓ Automatic (no delays)
✓ Consistent (everyone gets same access)
✓ Immediate (day one access)
✓ No request overhead
✓ No approval needed (universal access)
✓ No missed access (nothing to forget)
```

**Not Certified:**
```
Typically not included in certifications:
  - Universal access
  - Everyone has it
  - No business decision needed
  
Exception:
  - May certify account still active
  - But not certify THESE specific entitlements
```

---

**Scenario 2: All Sales Reps Need Salesforce, Sales Drives, and CRM Tools**

**Recommended: Role-Based Access**

**Analysis:**
```
Characteristics:
  - All sales reps need it
  - Standard for job function
  - Multiple systems (Salesforce, files, CRM)
  - Consistent requirement
  - Job-based access
  
Fits Role-Based Access:
  ✓ Define "Sales Representative" role
  ✓ Bundle all required entitlements
  ✓ Assign role to sales employees
  ✓ Everyone in role gets same access
```

**Implementation:**
```
Create Role: "Sales Representative"

Entitlements Included:
  Salesforce:
    - Sales Cloud User profile
    
  Active Directory:
    - Sales-Team group
    - Sales-Shared-Drive group
    
  Applications:
    - CRM-Tools access
    - Sales-Reports access
    
  Optional (if needed):
    - VPN-Users (remote access)
    - Mobile-App access
    
Total: 6-8 entitlements bundled

Assignment Method:
  
  Option A: Automated (Rule-Based)
    Rule: IF department = "Sales" 
          THEN assign "Sales Representative" role
    
    Result:
      - New sales hire aggregated from Workday
      - Department = Sales
      - Role automatically assigned
      - All entitlements provisioned
      - Day one access ✓
      
  Option B: Manual Assignment
    Process:
      - New sales hire: Bob Wilson
      - Admin assigns "Sales Representative" role
      - All entitlements provisioned
      
    Use when:
      - Department values not reliable
      - Need manual verification
      - Special cases
```

**Benefits:**
```
✓ Consistency:
  All sales reps have identical access
  No variance, no missed entitlements
  
✓ Easy Onboarding:
  Assign 1 role → 8 entitlements provisioned
  vs. manually requesting 8 items
  
✓ Easy Offboarding:
  Remove 1 role → 8 entitlements revoked
  Complete and fast
  
✓ Simple Certification:
  Certify role membership (1 decision)
  vs. certifying 8 entitlements individually
  
✓ Maintainability:
  Update role definition → all members updated
  vs. updating each person individually
```

**Example Usage:**
```
New Hire: Alice Johnson
Job Title: Sales Representative
Department: Sales

Day 1:
  - Workday aggregates to ISC
  - Department = Sales detected
  - "Sales Representative" role assigned automatically
  - Provisioning triggered:
    ✓ Salesforce: Sales Cloud User created
    ✓ AD: Added to Sales-Team
    ✓ AD: Added to Sales-Shared-Drive
    ✓ CRM-Tools: Access granted
    ✓ Sales-Reports: Access granted
    
  - Alice logs in day one
  - All access ready ✓
  - Can start selling immediately

Quarterly Certification:
  - Manager certifies: "Is Alice still Sales Representative?"
  - 1 decision (not 8 decisions)
  - Manager: Certify (yes, still sales rep)
  - All entitlements retained
```

**Why NOT Other Types:**
```
❌ Birthright:
  Not everyone needs Salesforce
  Sales-specific, not universal
  
❌ Access Profile:
  This is job-based, not request-based
  Should be automatic, not requested
  Cross-system (not single-app)
  
❌ Direct Access:
  Would need 8 individual grants
  Inconsistent across sales reps
  Hard to manage and certify
  
✓ Role-Based: Perfect fit
  Job function → role → entitlements
  Automatic, consistent, manageable
```

---

**Scenario 3: Marketing Employee Needs Temporary Finance Reports Access**

**Recommended: Direct Access (via Request)**

**Analysis:**
```
Characteristics:
  - Temporary need (project-specific)
  - Exception (marketing doesn't normally have finance access)
  - Individual request
  - Not standard for marketing role
  - Time-limited
  
Fits Direct Access:
  ✓ One-off request
  ✓ Temporary access
  ✓ Exception case
  ✓ Not role-based
  ✓ Individual approval needed
```

**Implementation:**
```
Request Process:

User: Sarah Martinez (Marketing Analyst)
Need: Finance reports for Q4 campaign analysis
Duration: 30 days (campaign duration)

Step 1: User requests access
  ISC → Request Access
  Browse catalog
  Select: "Finance-Reports-Access" (entitlement)
  
Step 2: Provide justification
  Justification: "Need sales and revenue data for Q4 marketing 
  campaign analysis. Project duration: 30 days."
  
  Business Need: "Marketing campaign planning"
  
  Duration: 30 days (time-limited request)
  
Step 3: Approval workflow
  Request routed to: Finance Manager (owner of finance reports)
  
  Finance Manager reviews:
    - Requester: Sarah Martinez (Marketing)
    - Access: Finance-Reports-Access
    - Justification: Campaign analysis
    - Duration: 30 days
    
  Finance Manager evaluates:
    ✓ Legitimate business need
    ✓ Marketing campaign makes sense
    ✓ Read-only access appropriate
    ✓ Time-limited (good)
    
  Decision: Approve
  
Step 4: Provisioning
  ISC provisions Finance-Reports-Access
  Sarah can access finance reports
  
Step 5: Auto-revocation after 30 days
  Day 30: Access automatically revoked
  Sarah no longer has finance access
  Back to normal marketing access
  
  Clean and automatic ✓
```

**Alternative: Access Profile (if common pattern):**
```
If many marketing people request finance reports:

Create Access Profile: "Finance Reporting Access"

Entitlements:
  - Finance-Reports-Reader
  - Tableau-Finance-Dashboards
  - Finance-SharePoint-Site
  
Then:
  User requests: "Finance Reporting Access" profile
  Gets all 3 entitlements together
  
Use when:
  - This is a common request pattern
  - Multiple entitlements needed together
  - Many users request it
```

**Benefits:**
```
✓ Flexibility:
  Handles exception/temporary needs
  Not locked into role definition
  
✓ Temporary:
  Time-limited grant
  Auto-revokes after expiration
  Clean and automatic
  
✓ Appropriate approval:
  Finance Manager decides finance access
  Not automatic (exception requires review)
  
✓ Audit trail:
  Request documented
  Justification captured
  Approval recorded
```

**Why NOT Other Types:**
```
❌ Birthright:
  Not everyone in marketing needs finance access
  Not universal or standard
  
❌ Role-Based:
  Not standard for marketing role
  Exception, not job requirement
  Temporary, not permanent
  
❌ Manual/Admin:
  Should go through approval process
  Finance manager should approve
  Not emergency situation
  
✓ Direct Access (via request): Perfect fit
  Exception handling
  Temporary access
  Appropriate approval
```

**Scenario 4: Many Users Request Same 3 VPN-Related Entitlements Together**

**Recommended: Access Profile**

**Analysis:**
```
Characteristics:
  - Common request pattern
  - Multiple entitlements requested together
  - Always the same 3 entitlements
  - Application-specific (VPN)
  - Requestable access
  
Fits Access Profile:
  ✓ Bundle common requests
  ✓ Simplify user experience
  ✓ Reduce approval overhead
  ✓ Application-focused bundle
```

**Problem (Before Access Profile):**
```
User workflow (current):
  1. Request: VPN-Users group
     Justification: "Work from home"
     Manager approves
     
  2. Request: Duo-MFA-Enabled
     Justification: "VPN requires MFA"
     Manager approves
     
  3. Request: VPN-License
     Justification: "VPN client license"
     Manager approves
     
Problems:
  - 3 separate requests
  - 3 separate approvals
  - Time-consuming for user
  - Annoying for manager
  - All 3 always requested together anyway!
```

**Solution (Access Profile):**
```
Create Access Profile: "VPN Remote Access"

Description:
  "Remote access to corporate network via VPN. Enables work from home 
  and travel. Includes VPN group membership, MFA enrollment, and VPN 
  client license."

Entitlements Included:
  Active Directory:
    - VPN-Users group
    
  Duo Security:
    - Duo-MFA-Enabled
    
  Cisco AnyConnect:
    - VPN-Client-License
    
Total: 3 entitlements bundled

Requestable: Yes
Approver: Manager
Justification: Required

New User Workflow:
  1. Request: "VPN Remote Access" profile (one request)
     Justification: "Work from home 3 days/week"
     Manager approves (one approval)
     
  2. Provisioning:
     ✓ Added to VPN-Users group
     ✓ MFA enabled
     ✓ VPN license assigned
     
  3. User gets email: "Your VPN access is ready"
     
  4. User can connect via VPN immediately
  
Benefits:
  - 1 request (not 3)
  - 1 approval (not 3)
  - 1 notification (not 3)
  - Faster for user
  - Easier for manager
  - All-or-nothing (consistent)
```

**Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Create Access Profile in ISC
  Admin → Access Profiles → Create
  
  Name: VPN Remote Access
  Description: [as above]
  
Step 2: Add Entitlements
  Add:
    - VPN-Users (Active Directory)
    - Duo-MFA-Enabled (Duo Security)
    - VPN-Client-License (Cisco AnyConnect)
    
Step 3: Configure Request Settings
  Requestable: Yes
  Approver: Manager
  Requires Justification: Yes
  
Step 4: Publish to Catalog
  Make visible in access request catalog
  
Step 5: Test
  Test user requests profile
  Verify all 3 entitlements provisioned
  
Step 6: Communicate
  Announce to employees:
    "Request 'VPN Remote Access' for work from home"
    Single request gets all VPN access
```

**Usage Example:**
Week 1:
10 users request VPN access
Before Access Profile:
- 10 users × 3 requests = 30 requests
- 30 manager approvals
- 30 provisioning operations
With Access Profile:
- 10 users × 1 request = 10 requests
- 10 manager approvals
- 10 provisioning operations (but each provisions 3 entitlements)
Result:
- 67% fewer requests
- 67% fewer approvals
- Much faster and easier ✓

**Certification Benefits:**
Quarterly Certification:
Manager reviews team member: Bob Wilson
Before Access Profile:
Certify or Revoke:
1. VPN-Users group?
2. Duo-MFA-Enabled?
3. VPN-Client-License?
3 decisions per person
With Access Profile:
Certify or Revoke:
1. VPN Remote Access profile?
1 decision per person
Result:

Simpler certification
Logical grouping
Manager understands "VPN access" as concept
Not confused by technical entitlements


**Why NOT Other Types:**
❌ Birthright:
Not everyone needs VPN
Only remote workers
❌ Role-Based:
Not job-specific
Cross-functional need (sales, IT, marketing all need VPN)
Not tied to single role
❌ Direct Access:
Current problem - 3 separate requests
Access profile solves this
✓ Access Profile: Perfect fit
Common request pattern
Application-specific bundle
User-requestable
Simplifies process

**When to Expand:**
Later, might add to profile:
If users who get VPN also typically need:

Remote Desktop access
Mobile device enrollment
Security awareness training

Consider:
Access Profile: "Remote Worker Access"
Includes:
- VPN access (3 entitlements)
- Remote Desktop access (2 entitlements)
- Mobile enrollment (1 entitlement)
Total: 6 entitlements in one request
Evolution:
Start small (VPN only)
Observe patterns
Expand profile as needed

**Summary Table:**

| Scenario | Access Type | Rationale | Implementation |
|----------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| **1. Email/Intranet (all employees)** | **Birthright** | Universal, everyone needs it | Birthright role auto-assigned to active employees |
| **2. Sales rep access** | **Role-Based** | Job function, consistent across all sales reps | "Sales Representative" role with 8 entitlements |
| **3. Temp finance reports (marketing)** | **Direct Access** | Temporary, exception, not role-based | Request entitlement with 30-day expiration |
| **4. VPN 3 entitlements together** | **Access Profile** | Common request pattern, always together | "VPN Remote Access" profile bundles 3 entitlements |

---

**Key Decision Factors:**

Email/Intranet → Birthright
Factor: Everyone needs it (universal)
Sales Access → Role-Based
Factor: Standard for job function
Marketing → Finance → Direct Access
Factor: Temporary exception
VPN Bundle → Access Profile
Factor: Common request pattern


---

**Learning Points:**
Birthright Access:

Universal or department-wide
Automatic assignment
No request needed
Day one access

Role-Based Access:

Job function definition
Cross-system bundles
Consistent for all in role
Simplified management

Direct Access:

Exceptions and temporary needs
Individual approvals
Time-limited possible
Flexible but harder to manage at scale

Access Profiles:

Common request patterns
Application-specific bundles
Simplify user experience
Reduce approval overhead


**Exam Tip:** Choose access type based on scope and pattern:
- Everyone → Birthright
- Job function → Role
- Temporary/Exception → Direct
- Common pattern → Access Profile

## Section Summary

**Core Concepts for Certification:**

✅ **Six Access Types:**
- **Direct Access**: Individual entitlements, one-off grants
- **Role-Based**: Job function bundles, cross-system
- **Access Profiles**: Application bundles, requestable
- **Birthright**: Automatic for all/department
- **Requested**: Self-service with approval
- **Manual**: Admin-provisioned, emergency

✅ **Direct Access:**
- Individual entitlements granted directly
- Use for: Exceptions, temporary needs, one-off requests
- Challenge: Hard to manage at scale, access sprawl
- Certification: Individual entitlement decisions

✅ **Role-Based Access:**
- Bundles entitlements for job function
- Cross-system (AD, Salesforce, apps, etc.)
- Usually automatic (department/job-based)
- Benefits: Consistency, easy onboarding/offboarding
- Certification: Role membership (simplified)

✅ **Access Profiles:**
- Pre-packaged bundles of related entitlements
- Application-specific (Salesforce, VPN, etc.)
- User-requestable
- Use for: Common request patterns
- Benefits: Simplify requests, reduce approvals

✅ **Birthright Access:**
- Automatic for all employees or departments
- No request needed
- Provisioned day one
- Examples: Email, intranet, employee portal
- Usually not certified (universal access)

✅ **Key Differences:**

| Type | Scope | Assignment | Use Case |
|------|-------|------------|----------|
| **Direct** | Single entitlement | Request/Manual | Exceptions |
| **Role** | Cross-system | Auto (job) | Job functions |
| **Profile** | App-specific | Request | Common patterns |
| **Birthright** | Universal/Dept | Auto (all) | Standard access |

**Exam Focus Areas:**
- Know role = job function, profile = application bundle
- Understand birthright = automatic for everyone
- Remember direct access = exceptions/temporary
- Know role-based simplifies certification
- Understand access profile bundles common requests
- Remember to use role for job functions, not direct access
- Know birthright assigned automatically (no request)

**Next:** Section 6.3.2: Direct Access vs. Role-Based Access

---

**Study Tips:**
- **Direct**: Individual entitlements, exceptions, temporary
- **Role**: Job function, cross-system, automatic
- **Profile**: Application bundle, common patterns, requestable
- **Birthright**: Everyone gets it, automatic, day one
- **Role vs. Profile**: Role = job (sales rep), Profile = app bundle (VPN access)
- **Use role for job functions** (consistent, manageable)
- **Use profile for common requests** (simplify process)
