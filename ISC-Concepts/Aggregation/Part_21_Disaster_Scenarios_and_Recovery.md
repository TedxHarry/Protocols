## The One Question This Part Answers

**How do I bring truth back when I no longer trust anything I see?**

Disaster is not noise.  
Disaster is the moment you stop believing the system.

Keep this in mind:

**Recovery is not speed. Recovery is restoring trust.**

---

## Where This Lives in the Engine

Trigger → Extract → Normalize → Persist → Correlate → Evaluate → Recompute → Publish

A disaster can begin in any phase.  
Recovery must respect the same order the engine thinks in.

You cannot fix the end before you fix the beginning.

---

## Mental Model

```
Truth breaks
   → Stop the engine from lying more
     → Find where the first lie began
       → Fix the rule that caused it
         → Rebuild truth slowly
           → Prove it is safe again
```

Recovery is a walk, not a jump.

---

## What a Disaster Really Is

Most disasters are not explosions.  
They are quiet:

- Changes stop arriving  
- Correlation drifts  
- Identities flip strangely  
- Access storms appear  
- Governance starts making unsafe decisions  

The real disaster moment is not when errors appear.  
It is when you stop trusting what “Completed” means.

---

## The First Truth: You Cannot Repair a Moving Machine

When truth is wrong, and jobs keep running,  
the engine keeps rewriting lies.

So the first act of recovery is not fixing.  
It is freezing.

Freezing is saying:

“Stop telling new stories until we fix the old one.”

---

## A Story

You notice thousands of users lost correlation overnight.  
Jobs still say Completed.  
UI is green.

But nothing feels right.

This is not a debugging session.  
This is a disaster.

Your first decision is not technical.  
It is philosophical:

“Do I still trust what this system is saying?”

If the answer is no, you freeze.

---

## Freezing Is Not Failure

Pausing schedules feels scary.  
But running broken logic is scarier.

While frozen:
- Truth stops drifting  
- History stops changing  
- You get a stable crime scene  

You cannot investigate while the evidence is moving.

---

## Finding the First Lie

Recovery always begins with one person, not ten thousand.

You pick someone clearly affected and ask:

- What does reality say about them?  
- What does the account show?  
- What does identity believe?  
- What access did they get?  

You walk the engine slowly and ask:

“Where did truth stop matching reality?”

The first mismatch is where disaster began.

---

## Disasters Have Personalities

Some disasters start early:

- Filters remove people  
- Pagination fails  
- Delta skips change  

Others start later:

- Mapping corrupts fields  
- Correlation mislinks  
- Identity rules flip meaning  
- Recompute storms rewrite access  

You don’t guess the type.  
You discover it by walking one person end to end.

---

## Fix Logic Before You Touch History

Never rebuild on broken logic.

If you rebuild while logic is wrong,  
you simply make wrong truth faster and louder.

So you fix:

- Filters  
- Mapping  
- Match logic  
- Identity rules  
- Delta handling  

But you prove the fix on one small slice of reality first.

If it cannot speak truth for one person,  
it cannot speak truth for everyone.

---

## Choosing How to Recover

There are two recovery paths in spirit, not in checklists.

Sometimes truth is only bruised.  
Sometimes truth is shattered.

If only a small area is wrong,  
you repair gently and expand slowly.

If you no longer trust memory at all,  
you wipe memory and rebuild from the ground up.

This decision is not technical.  
It is about trust.

Ask:

“Do I believe most of what this system remembers?”

If the answer is no, you rebuild.

---

## Rebuilding Is Re‑telling the Story of the World

A rebuild is saying:

“Forget what you think you know. Listen again.”

You let authoritative sources speak first.  
Then dependent sources follow.  
Then identities judge themselves again.  
Then access is decided again.

You are not fixing a system.  
You are re‑teaching it what reality is.

---

## Order Is Mercy

If you rebuild out of order, you create new lies.

People must exist before access attaches.  
Identity must be judged before access is granted.

So recovery follows the same rhythm as creation:

Truth of people → truth of identity → truth of access → truth of visibility.

---

## The Trust Boundary

At some point, you must say:

“From here forward, I believe you again.”

That moment is not chosen by feeling.  
It is chosen by proof.

You check:

- Source vs account  
- Account vs identity  
- Identity vs access  
- Access vs UI  

On multiple people.  
In multiple areas.

When the story is consistent, you declare trust.

Only after that should governance and automation fully resume.

---

## A Running Story

A match rule change uncorrelated thousands of accounts.

You freeze schedules.  
You fix the match rule.  
You test it on one department.  
It speaks truth.

You rebuild authoritative sources.  
Then dependent ones.  
Then identities judge again.  
Then access settles.

You test multiple people.  
The story matches reality.

That moment is the trust boundary.

Not when jobs say Completed.  
When you believe the story again.

---

## Recovery Is Also Human

During disaster, silence creates fear.

People need to know:

- What is broken  
- What is paused  
- What decisions should wait  
- When truth will return  

You are not just fixing a system.  
You are protecting trust between humans and machines.

---

## After the Storm

When truth is restored, you look backward.

Not to blame, but to learn:

- What broke first?  
- Why didn’t we see it early?  
- What signal was missing?  
- What would stop this next time?  

Disasters that teach you are not failures.  
They are tuition.

---

## What This Phase Does NOT Do

- It does not make broken logic safe  
- It does not replace proof with hope  
- It does not rush truth back into the world  

It only gives you a way to return from not knowing.

---

## The One Sentence That Defines Mastery

When everything feels wrong, ask:

**Where did the first lie begin, and how do I stop it from speaking again?**

---

## Mastery Check

Answer without notes:

- Why must you freeze before fixing?  
- Why do you start with one person?  
- Why is rebuilding re‑teaching reality?  
- What is a trust boundary in human terms?  
- Why is recovery about belief, not speed?
